<p>The FLO-2D PRO two-dimensional flood routing model was integrated with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) Version 5.0.022 in 2013.
The FLO-2D storm drain engine has evolved into a completely new and unique model component.
The FLO-2D storm drain engine simulates the exchange of surface water flow with a storm drain system as
a flow continuum (one body of water).
As two-dimensional flood modeling has advanced in the urban setting, the original SWMM interaction
between the surface and the storm drain system is too basic to capture the physical processes of the
system.
A FLO-2D storm drain system represents a significant advancement in storm drain detail, accuracy, and
speed.</p>
<p>In the coupled model system FLO-2D hosts the closed conduit storm drain system and both models run
simultaneously.
FLO-2D calculates all hydrologic and hydraulic flood routing while the closed conduit component computes
the storm drain hydraulics.
The integration process involves allowing both systems to share data on a computational timestep
controlled by the FLO-2D surface water engine.
The storm drain inlet discharge and the potential return flow to the surface is a function of the water
surface elevation (WSE) and the storm drain pressure requiring seamless sharing of data.
Both data sets must have the same coordinate system.
The FLO-2D model will compute the storm drain inflow discharge based on the predicted grid element
headwater depth and inlet geometry type.
This inlet-controlled discharge will then be routed as storm drain conduit discharge.
The storm drain return flow to the surface water system is exchanged through storm drain inlets/outlets
and outfalls.
The complete conceptualized flood routing system is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/image115.png" src="../../_images/image115.png" />
<p><em>Figure 1.
Conceptualized FLO-2D Model System with a Storm Drain Component.</em></p>
<p>The FLO-2D storm drain component can be visualized in layers.
The surficial layer represents all the surface water flood movement which is connected to the
subsurface pipe layer through the pipe junctions defined as inlets (or outfalls).
Figure 2 illustrates the layered system.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/image212.png" src="../../_images/image212.png" />
<p><em>Figure 2.
Volume Exchange between the Surface Water and Storm Drain System.</em></p>
<p>The FLO-2D storm drain component can be applied to a variety of different storm water projects including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Assessment of the storm drain capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Storm drain response to floods events.</p></li>
<li><p>Design and mitigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Urban surface features (levees, walls, streets, channels) and their impact on the storm drain system.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment of the reduction in capacity to collect, convey and discharge stormwater flows to low lying
coastal areas due to sea level rise and high tides.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The FLO-2D storm drain system can be developed using the FLO-2D plugin for QGIS and the EPA SWMM
Graphical User Interface (GUI) or other storm drain software.
The EPA SWMM GUI (Build 5.0.022) is installed with FLO-2D.
Once the storm drain system is built and the run switch is set, the flow into and through the pipe
system is simulated automatically when the FLO-2D model is started.
Following a successful simulation, the storm drain results can be reviewed in QGIS or in the EPA SWMM GUI.
Figure 3 shows an example of a storm drain integrated with a surface model on a QGIS map.</p>

<p>The enhancements to the original SWMM model are extensive.
Some of the enhancements are related to the water surface head on the storm drain system.
The original SWMM model did not predict or utilize surface water elevation.
The FLO-2D model computes the storm drain inlet inflow discharge based on the inlet geometry and the
head on the inlet and shares the discharge with the storm drain engine.
The inlet and outfall exchange with the surface water including return flow to the storm drain system
are based on the comparison between the water surface elevation and the hydraulic head not just the
rim elevation.
There are several enhancements to the outfall functions.
Finally, there have been several enhancements made to both model codes that include timestep management,
inlet geometry, manhole covers, storm drain return flows, reporting output, and feature options.</p>
<section id="computational-timesteps">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Computational Timesteps<a class="headerlink" href="#computational-timesteps" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A timestep synchronization method is used in the FLO-2D Storm Drain Model.
The surface water and the storm drain systems communicate at each FLO-2D computational timestep.
The storm drain system uses the FLO-2D computational timestep for the water volume exchange as well as
for the flow routing through the pipe system.
With the frequent water volume exchange at each FLO-2D computational timestep, any inconsistency between
the volumes leaving the surface water and entering the storm drain system are eliminated.
The storm drain routing timestep is set up as the FLO-2D timestep for the dynamic wave solution
throughout the simulation for all conditions, regardless user sets up a fixed timestep or a variable
timestep.</p>
<p>The FLO-2D timesteps are small enough for the storm drain solution to converge.
For all conditions, the computed variable timestep is equal to the FLO-2D computational timestep.</p>

<section id="inlet-geometry">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.2. </span>Inlet Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#inlet-geometry" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In the original SWMM model, pipe discharge was based on the system conveyance capacity, ignoring the
inlets discharge capacity (control).
The FLO-2D storm drain model computes the storm drain inlet discharge based on the storm drain inlet
geometry and the predicted water surface elevations.
An inlet can be assigned to a floodplain, channel, or street element.
Three inlet options represent typical storm drain inlet designs.
A fourth option enables a stage-discharge rating table or the use of the generalized culvert equation
for a unique inlet condition (INTYPE= 4) and a fifth option will simulate a manhole (INTYPE=5).</p>
</section>
<section id="flooding-conditions">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.3. </span>Flooding Conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#flooding-conditions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The EPA SWMM5 model introduced a ponding feature to enhance the flooding approach used by the EPA SWMM
4 model.
The purpose of this feature was to emulate surface water that would both keep the excess storm drain
water under pressure and return flow to the system when storage capacity became available.
The ponding feature is activated when the inlet storm drain pressure head exceeds rim elevation.
Two overflow conditions were evaluated by the SWMM model when the pressure head exceeds the rim elevation:</p>
<p><strong>Flooding:</strong> Excess volume in the storm drain overflows and is lost because there is no inlet temporary
storage.
Hydraulic head at the node will not rise above the inlet rim + surcharge depth.
This approach is a simplification that ignores the additional surface water head that may force more
water to move through the pipe system.</p>
<p><strong>Ponding:</strong> This routine was created to represent a surface water layer in the EPA SWMM 5 model.
Inlet overflow is stored at the node until such time when the pressure head is reduced below the rim
elevation and the stored volume is released back to the storm drain system.
In this case, the overflow volume is never lost from the storm drain system.
Ponded nodes do not contribute any volume to the surface water and in the flow routing continuity report
any remaining ponded volume at the end of the simulation is reported as Final Stored Volume.
The ponded volume continues to increase with more inlet overflow (return flow).
To enable return flow, the catch basin pressure head must exceed the rim elevation plus surcharge depth
(manhole cover).
The rate of the rise in the pressure head depends on multiple factors including the available ponded area.
There is no maximum ponded volume.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The global ponding options were off and none of the nodes could store volume.
The flooding option was applied for this case.</p></li>
<li><p>The Allow Ponding option was selected, and those nonzero ponded area nodes would receive ponded water.
Nodes with a zero-ponded area would receive flooding water.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When an inlet is flooded, the computed depth will decrease to the rim elevation and the overflow lost
from the system is considered excess inflow into the node.
For a ponded node, the depth is based on volume divided by the ponded area.
The smaller the assigned ponded area, the higher the water rises and drains.
The ponded area affects how quickly ponded water re-enters the storm drain system because it defines
the pressure head at node.
The program accounts for the ponded volume so the pressure head can be computed for the next time step.</p>
<p>EPA SWMM5 ponded routine represents an unrealistic condition where the storm drain water under pressure
exceeding the rim elevation is accumulated at an inlet but does not return to the surface water to
flow away from the inlet.
This is because the SWMM model cannot route surface water.
Since the FLO-2D model routes the surface water and predicts flood hydraulics, the SWMM ponding feature
was modified.
Consideration was given to the fact that no inflow should occur during flooding conditions in the storm
drain.
If the inflow to inlet is ceased at the moment there is no storm drain capacity, discharge oscillations
can physically occur.
This is an actual response of the storm drain system to the surface water.</p>
<p>There are two pressure conditions that had to be assessed in the revised ponding feature:</p>
<p>FLO-2D WSE &gt; storm drain pressure head &gt; rim elevation:</p>
<p>The conduit water volume under pressure stays in the pipe and the return volume is assigned to the
drop basin pipe based on its flow area.
No volume is lost from the storm drain system to the surface water and the volume stays in the pipe.
The pressure head in the storm drain is correctly represented for this condition.
For the second condition:</p>
<p>FLO-2D WSE &lt; storm drain pressure head &gt; rim elevation</p>
<p>When the storm drain pressure exceeds the surface water elevation, the water should overflow the
inlet and join the surface water to be routed away from the inlet and there is no storage volume
in the pipe system.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Surface Water – Storm Drain Exchange Conditions:<a class="headerlink" href="#surface-water-storm-drain-exchange-conditions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When the storm drain capacity is exceeded and is under pressure, the return flooding volume becomes
part of the surface water in the FLO-2D model if the pressure head exceeds the FLO-2D water surface
elevation.
When an inlet has orifice flow and the flow depth is higher than the curb height, water is pouring into
the storm drain conduit.
As the storm drain fills and the pipe water surface approaches the inlet rim elevation there is a rapid
increase in pressure head in the catch basin.
When this occurs, oscillations may be noted in the storm drain pressure and discharge plots.
The current interaction between the surface water and storm drain system is described above.
The conditions that control the inlet flow direction are described below and shown from Figure 4
through Figure 7:</p>

<section id="pressure-head-variability">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>Pressure head variability<a class="headerlink" href="#pressure-head-variability" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The FLO-2D Storm Drain system for the water exchange between the surface and the storm drain may result
in pressure head variability, conduit velocity fluctuations and different return flow results for
inlets and manholes under pressure when compared with SWMM models or early FLO-2D storm drain models.
The following response can be observed in the FLO-2D storm drain results:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The head on the inlet continuously increases when the PH is less than the FLO-2D WSE even though the
head exceeds the rim elevation.
Since the inlets are flooded, this results in higher storm drain pressure.
The volume above the rim is not released to the surface until the PH exceeds the FLO-2D WSE.</p></li>
<li><p>For underwater inlets, the higher-pressure head pushes more water through the downstream conduits at
higher velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher velocities in downstream conduits may result in higher discharges in various locations in the
storm drain with a possible corresponding
reduction in the return flow to the surface water for some inlets and manholes.
Maintaining continuity in the storm drain system, there may be sufficient head to force the flow to the outfalls instead of overflowing the inlets and
manholes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Summarizing, higher upstream pressure head on inlets (higher FLO-2D WSE) may result in a change in the
distribution between the return flow from a popped manhole or inlet compared the downstream conduit
flow through the outfall nodes.
This is a physical process that was not simulated in the original SWMM storm drain engine.</p>
</section>
<section id="outfall-discharge">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.5. </span>Outfall Discharge<a class="headerlink" href="#outfall-discharge" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The FLO-2D plugin will create the SWMMOUTF.DAT containing the outfall nodes that are defined in the
SWMM.inp file.
The outfall discharge to the surface water can be turned ‘on’ = 1, 2 or ‘off’ = 0 in QGIS.</p>
<p>On = 1 – Setting the switch to 1 will allow discharge to the grid system.</p>
<p>On = 2 – Setting the switch to 2 will allow the discharge to the grid system but ignore the underground
depth to the outfall node.
This switch can be used when the outfall is underground or bubble-up and the discharge is causing
numerical instability.</p>
<p>Off = 0 – Setting the outfall switch to ‘off’ acts like a sink and water is not exchanged with the
grid system.
This switch is used along boundaries.</p>
<p>The outfall nodes listed in the SWMMOUTF.DAT file should be in the same order as they appear in the
SWMM.inp file.
When the outfall order is modified in the SWMM.inp, the SWMMOUTF.DAT should be modified too.
The FLO-2D plugin should automate this but it is a good check to perform.</p>
<p>If the outfall switch is ‘on’ and equal to 1 or 2, then a full interaction between the surface grid
cell and the outfall feature is calculated, FLO-2D water surface elevation and storm drain pressure
head are compared, and the outfall will discharge to the surface water until the FLO-2D water
surface elevation is equal to or greater than the pressure head.
Potential backflow into the outfall pipe depends on the comparison of the water surface elevation and
the outfall pressure head, and on the assignment of a Tide Gate structure in the SWMM.inp file.
Outfall discharge from storm drain to the FLO-2D surface water is reported to the SWMMOUTFIN.OUT file.
This file lists the grid element (or channel element if applicable) in the first line followed by the
hydrograph with time and discharge pairs.</p>
<p>The invert elevation of outfalls can be less than the floodplain, channel, or street elevations.
This may occur for a ponded surface water condition that is assigned as a ground elevation because it
would not contribute to downstream flooding.
An outfall invert underground (or underwater) is imposed for this condition (Figure 8).
An artificial head equal to the ground elevation is assigned to the outfall node (for the entire
simulation) if the outfall discharge to the surface water is turned ‘on’ and set to 1.
This artificial head causes the pipe to fill, and the artificial volume is accounted for in the storm
drain model.
For underground outfalls, a switch equal to 2 can be used, where the artificial head equal to the
ground elevation is not assigned to the outfall node and only the FLO-2D WSE is assigned for the
entire simulation.
When the model runs, the inflow may be added to either the outfall grid element or the upstream storm
drain conduit network and the flow can go either in or out of the outfall pipe based on the pressure head.</p>

<p><em>Figure 8.
Initial Condition for an Underground (Underwater) Storm Drain Outfall</em></p>
<p>Typically, an outfall has an invert elevation equal to or greater than the floodplain, channel, or
street elevations.
To account for volume conservation, the storm drain outflow that represents inflow volume to a FLO-2D
channel is reported in the CHVOLUME.OUT file.
Water will flow in or out of the outfall pipe based on the head comparison.
Water can enter the storm drain when the water surface elevation is greater than the invert, but it can
also be evacuated from the storm drain if the pressure head is above the water surface elevation.</p>

<p>A storm drain inlet can be simulated as an outlet with a flapgate to stop the surface water from
entering the storm drain system (Type 4 inlet).
The flapgate switch in SWMMFLO.DAT has the following settings:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Feature = 0, No flapgate – horizontal inlet opening</p>
<p>Feature = 1, No flapgate – vertical inlet opening, see Figure 9.</p>
<p>Feature = 2, Flapgate ‘on’ for simulated outlet</p>
<p>Feature = 3, Turn off the reduction of the discharge in the inlet when drop box capacity is
exceeded</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes nodes seem like an outfall but need to interact with the storm drain system differently.
These can be set up as inlets that will discharge flow from the storm drain to the surface water.

<p>Manholes function as covered inlets.
The manhole cover lift-off (popping) is simulated by assigning the surcharge depth in the SWMMFLO.DAT
file (Type 5 inlet).
When the cover is in place there is no flow exchange.
Discharge exchange between FLO-2D and the manhole junction box is calculated only after the manhole
cover has popped.
To pop the cover, the storm drain pressure plus surcharge depth must exceed the surface water elevation.
Once the cover is off, the surcharge depth is set to 0, the cover stays off and inlet discharge or
return flow can be calculated.
Flooding occurs at manholes when the pressure head at node is above manhole invert + maximum surface
depth + surcharge depth.</p>
<p>SDManholePopUp.OUT and ManholePop.OUT are created when at least one manhole pops in the storm drain system.

<p>For each timestep, the FLO-2D grid element water surface elevation (flow depth) is used to calculate
the discharge that passes through the inlets using the weir and orifice equations as well as the
geometry of the inlets defined by the user in the SWMMFLO.DAT file.
This uniform water surface elevation over the grid element does not take into consideration a street
cross slope and thus will under-predict the flow into the drain.
Using an assumed 2% street cross slope results in a higher depth (more head) on the storm drain inlet
(see Figure 10 and Figure 11).
The curb height can be entered in the SWMMFLO.DAT file to make this adjustment automatically for each
inlet.
The curb inlet flow assignment is the same concept as the Street Gutter Flow feature (requires
GUTTER.DAT file) that can be applied to gutters in streets without storm drain inlets.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.9. </span>Storm Drain Pressure Head Variation Dampening<a class="headerlink" href="#storm-drain-pressure-head-variation-dampening" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In the original SWMM model, to avoid rapid pressure fluctuation that induces discharge oscillations
in the drop boxes, the storm drain engine had a pressure dampening algorithm.
This algorithm used the surface area of the lateral conduit connected to the drop box.
As the conduit water surface elevation approached the soffit, the algorithm applied a decreasing water
surface area.
Once the flow reached the soffit, the pressure head dampening method is applied for a distance above
the invert of 1.25 times the conduit pipe diameter.
The surface area was then exponentially reduced to the drop box diameter as the flow filled the catch
basin over the prescribed distance.
The justification for this dampening routine is that the pressure head change in one computational
timestep may be sufficient to fill a four-foot drop box causing both oscillation and volume conservation
error.
During a storm this may occur as evidenced by manhole popping or spraying of water from inlets.</p>
<p>To represent the physical system, the pressure head dampening routine was reviewed and several options
to revise the dampening algorithm were evaluated including allowing the pressure head variation up
to be exponentially reduced over more effectively to entire drop box to the rim elevation.
The Figure 14 through Figure 17 display water profiles and the pressure head versus time for an upstream
inlet that has an inflow condition that fills the vertical pipe above the rim elevation.
This example shows how the pressure head calculation is affected for three different dampening methods
when the pressure head exceeds the soffit elevation.
The selected method allows the pressure head to be exponentially reduced over to entire drop box to the
RIM elevation.</p>

There is contraction in the flow area between the catch basin of an inlet (vertical pipe) and the inlet.
The sudden contraction at the inlet from the drop box pipe diameter results in an energy loss in the

<p>S<sub>f</sub> = friction slope or head loss per unit length of pipe</p>
<p>h<sub>L</sub> = local energy loss per unit length of pipe</p>
<p>g = gravitational acceleration</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These equations are solved for the discharge Q and head H in each pipe by setting the initial conditions
for H and Q at the beginning of the simulation as well as setting the boundary conditions at the
beginning and end of each conduit for all timesteps.
For each pipe, the geometry (flow area A) is known as a function of the flow depth y and head H.
Unsteady flows are routed through a network of closed conduits.
Unsteady flow with backwater effects, flow reversals, pressurized flow with entrance/exit energy losses
and other conditions can be simulated (Rossman, 2005).
The momentum equation inertial terms are reduced as flow comes closer to being critical and are
ignored when the flow is supercritical based on the following options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Damping option (KEEP) - inertial terms of the St.
Venant equation solution are included.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore option (IGNORE) - inertial terms are ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>Dampen option (DAMPEN) - implements Local Partial Inertial modification (LPI).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the FLO-2D model the LPI damping option is always applied, this is hardwired in the FLO-2D Storm
Drain model.
The simulation of unsteady flows with subcritical/supercritical mixed flow regimes is accomplished by
neglecting varying portions of the inertial terms in the unsteady momentum equations according to the
local Froude number.
A weighting factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> which ranges between 0 and 1 is utilized.
This parameter damps out the contribution of the inertial terms as the Froude number Fr increases
and approaches 1.0 and ignores them completely when
the Froude number is greater than 1 (supercritical flow).
The weighting factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> varies as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sigma = 1.0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ Fr &lt; 0.5\]</div>

\[\sigma = 0.\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ Fr &gt; 1.0\]</div>
<p>The inertial terms are multiplied by σ when they are added into the solution of the momentum equation
for each timestep and conduit.
The Froude number is calculated at the midpoint depth in the conduit.
This solution (DAMPEN) produces more stable results around the critical stage of the flow but retains
the essential accuracy of the fully dynamic solution at sub-critical flow conditions.</p>
<p>The friction slope component S<sub>f</sub> is based on Manning’s equation:</p>

Explicit schemes for these types of solutions are limited to minor steps by strict numerical stability

<p>The average area<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ \overline{A}\)</span>, hydraulic radius<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ \overline{R}\)</span>, and velocity
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{V}\)</span> are computed using the heads H:sub:<cite>1</cite> and H<sub>2</sub> at either end of the
conduit from which corresponding flow depth values y<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>2</sub> can be derived.
An average depth <em>y</em> is then computed by averaging these values and is used with the cross-section
geometry of the conduit to compute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{A}\)</span> and<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ \overline{R}\)</span>.
The average velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{V}\)</span> is determined by dividing the most current discharge by the
average flow area.
A limitation on this velocity is coded to prevent unbounded frictional flow adjustments.
Consequently, the velocity cannot be higher than 50 ft/sec.</p>
<p>For a conduit with free fall discharge into either of its end nodes, the depth at the end of the
conduit for the node below the invert elevation of the conduit is set equal to the smaller of the
critical depth and the normal flow depth for the conduit flow.
The equation to calculate the head adjustment term for each timestep at each node is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[H_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t} = H_{t} + \frac{\mathrm{\Delta}Vol}{\left( A_{store} +
\sum_{}^{}A_{s} \right)_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t}}\]</div>
<p>where ∆Vol is the net volume flowing through the node over the timestep.
The net volume is computed as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathrm{\Delta}Vol = 0.5\left\lbrack \left( \sum_{}^{}Q \right)_{t} +
\left( \sum_{}^{}Q \right)_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t} \right\rbrack\mathrm{\Delta}t\ \\]</div>
<p>The conduit surface area (A<sub>store</sub>) depends on the flow condition within the conduit as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Under normal conditions the pipe surface area equals half of the conduit length times the average
of the top width at the end and mid points of the conduit.
These widths are evaluated before the next updated timestep using the flow depths
y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, and y.</p></li>
<li><p>If the inflow of the conduit to a node is in free-fall (conduit invert elevation is above the
water surface of the node), then the conduit does not contribute to the node surface area.</p></li>
<li><p>For conduits with closed shapes such as circular pipes that are greater than 96 percent full,
a constant top width equal to the width when 96 percent full is used.
This prevents the head adjustment term H<sub>t</sub> from creating numerical instability as the
top width and corresponding surface area approach zero when the conduit reaches a full condition.
A minimum surface area for A<sub>store</sub> is assigned to all nodes, including junctions that
normally have no storage volume, preventing H<sub>t</sub> from becoming unbounded.
Under normal conditions A<sub>store</sub> equals half the conduit’s length times the average of the
top width at the end- and mid-points of the conduit.
These widths are evaluated before the next updated flow solution is found, using the flow depths
y1, y2, and y discussed previously.
The default value for this minimum area is 12.57 ft<sup>2</sup> which corresponds to the area of
a 4-foot diameter manhole.</p></li>

<p>To calculate the discharge Q and the head H, the equations are solved for each timestep using a method
of successive approximations with under-relaxation (Rossman, 2005).
The solution algorithm involves the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>A first estimate of discharge Q in each conduit at time <em>t +</em> Δ<em>t</em> is calculated by solving
for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t}\)</span> using the heads,
areas, and velocities determined at the current time <em>t</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A first estimate of the head (H) in each conduit at time <em>t +</em> Δ<em>t</em> is calculated by evaluating
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t}\)</span> using the discharge Q just computed.
The results are denoted as:</p>
<p>Q<sub>last</sub> and H<sub>last</sub></p>
</li>
<li><p>The equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t}\)</span> is solved once again, using the head, area, and
velocity based on the Q<sub>last</sub> and H<sub>last</sub> values just computed.
A relaxation factor Ω is used to combine the new flow estimate Q<sub>new</sub> with the previous
estimate Q<sub>last</sub> to generate a new Q<sub>new</sub> according to the equation:</p>
<p>Q<sub>new</sub> = (1−Ω) Q<sub>last</sub> +Ω Q<sub>new</sub></p>
</li>
<li><p>The equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{t + \mathrm{\Delta}t}\)</span>is solved again for heads using Q<sub>new</sub>.
As with discharge, this new solution for head, H<sub>new</sub> is weighted with H<sub>last</sub> to
produce an updated estimate for heads:</p>
<p>H<sub>new</sub> = (1−Ω) H<sub>last</sub> +Ω H<sub>new</sub></p>
</li>
<li><p>If H<sub>new</sub> is close enough to H<sub>last</sub> then the process stops with Q<sub>new</sub>
and H<sub>new</sub> as the solution for time t + Δt.
Otherwise H<sub>last</sub> and Q<sub>last</sub> are replaced with H<sub>new</sub> and Q<sub>new</sub>,
respectively and the process returns to step 2.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The procedure uses the following parameters and conditions for this iterative procedure:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A constant relaxation factor Ω is equal to 0.5.</p></li>
<li><p>A convergence tolerance of 0.005 feet on nodal heads.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of trials is limited to four.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The flow depth in conduits that are not surcharged is limited not to exceed the normal flow depth for
the discharge at the upstream end of the conduit whenever the flow regime is supercritical.
FLO-2D storm drain model uses the water surface slope and Froude number to determine when supercritical
flow occurs in a conduit.</p>

<p>A node is defined to be in a surcharged condition when its water level exceeds the crown of the highest
conduit connected to it.
Under this condition the surface area of any closed conduit would be zero and the equation for the
change in the pressure head would no longer be applicable.</p>
<p>An additional criterion is needed to calculate the nodal continuity condition.
The total rate of outflow from a surcharged node must equal the total rate of inflow equation is

<p>To implement the flow continuity condition, a perturbation equation form is enforced:</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.12.4. </span>Boundary conditions – FLO-2D inlet discharge<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-conditions-flo-2d-inlet-discharge" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Floodplain runoff discharges from the surface layer typically only enters the pipeline system at inlets.
Weir and orifice equations are used to calculate an inflow discharge under inlet control.
In the original SWMM model there was no inlet control and all the water in the subcatchment was made
available to the storm drain system capacity.
With inlet control, the inlet discharge is based on the inlet geometry and on the comparison between
the FLO-2D water surface elevation and the storm drain pressure head.
The inlet discharge is imposed as surface water boundary conditions (BC) and is passed to the storm
drain layer for routing.
The following equations (Johnson and Fred, 1984) are used:</p>
<p>Weir Flow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{w} = CLH^{m}\)</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{w}\)</span> = weir discharge</p>
<p>C = weir coefficient, enter in the “Inlet Weir Coeff.” field in the SWMMFLO.DAT</p>
<p>L = crest length; enter in the “Length (1 or 2)” field in the SWMMFLO.DAT</p>
<p>H = FLO-2D grid element water depth that contains the inlet structure</p>
<p>m = 1.5 for a broad crested weir.
This is hardcoded.</p>
<p>Orifice Flow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{o} = \ C_{d}A\sqrt{2gH}\)</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{o}\)</span> = orifice flow rate at depth H</p>
<p>C<sub>d</sub>  = discharge coefficient hardcoded to 0.67</p>
<p>A = Lh; cross-sectional orifice area, computed from inlet opening length (L) and inlet opening height
(h) fields in the SWMMFLO.DAT</p>
<p>g = gravitational acceleration</p>
<p>H = FLO-2D grid element water depth that contains the inlet structure</p>
<p>The discharges are calculated based on the physical behavior of the inlet as a weir or an orifice for
a given timestep and the smaller of the two discharges is used in the surface water exchange to the
storm drain system.
Using orifice flow accounts for the gutter velocity that would reduce the weir flow discharge.</p>

<span id="section-1"></span><h2><span class="section-number">1.13. </span>Surface Water – Storm Drain Model Integration<a class="headerlink" href="#surface-water-storm-drain-model-integration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The FLO-2D model moves around blocks of water on a discretized grid system.
Grid elements assigned as inlets/outfalls connect the surface layer with the closed conduit storm drain
system.
A comparison of the grid element water surface elevation with the pressure head from the closed conduit
system node in each cell determines the direction of the flow exchanged between the two systems.
The models are fully integrated on a computational timestep basis.</p>
<p>The advantages of the FLO-2D storm drain component over the original SWMM model are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Complete surface water hydrology and hydraulics including rainfall runoff, infiltration, and flood
routing in channels, streets or unconfined overland flow are simulated by FLO-2D surface water model.</p></li>
<li><p>The storm drain component solves the pipe hydraulics and flow routing but integrates the inlet/outlets
and outfalls with the surface water at each computational timestep.</p></li>
<li><p>FLO-2D computes the storm drain inlet discharge based on the water surface head and the inlet geometry.
The original SWMM model did not consider inlet control.</p></li>
<li><p>Only those junctions set up as inlets/outfalls in the storm drain model are recognized for system
exchange.
Pipe junctions without an inlet will not receive a surface runoff discharge.</p></li>
<li><p>The inlet locations digitized in storm drain data files (*.INP) are automatically read by the FLO-2D
QGIS to establish the storm drain inlet connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Inlets can become outlets if the storm drain pressure head exceeds the grid element water surface
elevation at a given node.
The potential return flow to the surface water is based on the water surface elevation not the rim
elevation as in the original SWMM model.</p></li>
<li><p>Manhole covers can pop and allow return flow based on a surcharge depth representing the manhole
cover weight.
Once popped the manhole surcharge is turned ‘off’ and the manhole functions as an inlet/outlet for
the rest of the simulation.
This is an improvement on the original SWMM model.</p></li>
<li><p>For outfall nodes in the closed conduit system network, pipe discharge can be removed from the storm
drain system or returned to the surface water as a user defined option.
The outfall can function as an inlet to the storm drain system based on the surface water elevation.
A tide gate can be used to prevent inflow to the outfall.
The integration of the outfall boundary conditions with surface water represents an enhancement over
the original SWMM model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To integrate the surface water and storm drain models, the first task is to develop a running FLO-2D
surface water flood model.
Then the storm drain model can be built with the assigned inlets/manholes/outfalls for surface water
exchange.</p>

The flow through a pump is computed as a function of the heads at their end nodes.
Pumps can be simulated in FLO-2D as part of the storm drain system or as a hydraulic structure in the

<p>Flow regulators are devices used to divert flow and can be applied to control releases from storage
facilities, prevent surcharging or convey flow to interceptors.
They are represented as a link connecting two nodes.
The flow regulator discharge is computed as a function of the head at the end nodes.
Most of the flow regulators devices control the surface flow, therefore they have been simulated using
the surface features, example: a ponded area with a weir structure that drains to the storm drain system.
The storm drain model can simulate a regulator as a storage unit with a weir.
The ponded area belongs to the surface layer; therefore the correct method is to simulate this using a
depressed storage area in the surface grid with a Type 4 inlet connecting the storage facility with
the storm drain system.</p>
<p>There are specific configurations where the flow regulators control the storm drain flow.
For these cases, the flow regulator feature must be simulated in the storm drain layer.
An example is a large catch basin with an opening in the inlet wall (orifice).
This component belongs to the storm drain layer and it needs to be modeled as a storage unit with an
orifice.</p>
