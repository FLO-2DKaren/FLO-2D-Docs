Overview
-------------

The Storm Drain Editor widget has several functions to prepare the data that integrates the FLO-2D surface water model
with the storm drain model.  This document will show different methodologies to set up a storm drain system and
to connect it to the grid elements.

The widget has functions that are outlined in red in the following image.  Each of these blocks is covered in
different sections that can be selected on the left side content table.

Storm Drain Resources
------------------------

FLO-2D incorporates a modified version of the EPA SWMM 5.0 engine to manage its storm drain modeling, which is both
complex and detailed. Below are some resources to assist in developing effective modeling practices.

1. Start with an advanced tutorial. This will give a good example of a real storm drain model.

3. EPA SWMM Documentation 5.0 is installed with EPA SWMM.

   C:\\Program Files (x86)\\EPA SWMM 5.0\\epaswmm5.chm

4. Open SWMM Documentation and Forum is an excellent resource for general storm drain modeling questions.

5. ChatGPT is an excellent quick reference but be careful because it often uses the wrong version of a software when it
   provides help.
