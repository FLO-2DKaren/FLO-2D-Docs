Convert a GeoPackage to the New Schema
=================================================

When working with the FLO-2D Gila Plugin, you may encounter projects created with older versions of the plugin that require a GeoPackage update. This guide provides instructions on how to port a GeoPackage to the new schema used by the FLO-2D Gila Plugin.

As the FLO-2D Gila Plugin evolves, the structure of the GeoPackage database is periodically updated to support new tools and features. When opening a project created with an older version of the plugin, the GeoPackage may need to be updated to match the current schema.

Use the video tutorials below to guide the update process based on your plugin version:

- FLO-2D Plugin v0.10.115: Uses a manual import method to transfer data into the updated GeoPackage structure.
- FLO-2D Plugin v1.0.0 and later: Provides an automated GeoPackage conversion tool to streamline the update process.
