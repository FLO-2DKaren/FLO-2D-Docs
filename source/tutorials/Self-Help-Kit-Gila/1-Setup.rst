Close and Reload QGIS
_____________________________________

Closing and restarting QGIS ensures that the *User Profile* is saved. If QGIS crashes before being closed after the
initial setup, the setup process must be repeated.

Each user account has a distinct profile. If another user logs into the computer, a separate QGIS profile must be
configured. For example, a student account on a shared computer will not have the same QGIS configuration as an
administrative account.
