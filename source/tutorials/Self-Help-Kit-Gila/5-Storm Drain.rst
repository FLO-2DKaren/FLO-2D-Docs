Storm drain checklist.

For those of you who love a challenge, it's good practice to do a "Speed Run" of the Self-Help
Kit.  Here is a checklist of tasks that might get skipped during storm drain model building.

- [ ] Adjust outfall location so all outfalls rest on a left bank node.
- [ ] Add a storage unit volume table and assign `Storage1` to all storage units.
- [ ] Ensure conduit length is a minimum of 30 ft, which is the cell size.
- [ ] Add Type 4 rating tables to the Type 4 inlets.
- [ ] Add a pump table and assign it to `P1`.
- [ ] Auto-assign nodes.
- [ ] Carefully inspect shapefile fields.
- [ ] Check storm drain control settings.
- [ ] Schematize the network.
- [ ] Perform a test run.

This lesson provides an introduction to importing and understanding the storm drain system in FLO-2D using QGIS.

Step 1: Import Storm Drain Shapefiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Load storm drain shapefiles into your project.
- Sort files by type and select those labeled as **shapefiles**.
- Drag and drop into a **Storm Drain** group in your QGIS layer panel.

Step 2: Understanding FLO-2D Storm Drain Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- FLO-2D handles most drainage through the **surface model**:
  - Channels and detention basins are modeled at the surface.
  - Inlets and outfalls interface with the surface system.

.. note::
   You do **not** need subcatchments, rain gauges, or separate infiltration models like in SWMM.

- Storm drains receive water from:
  - Streets and inlets (inflow)
  - Outfalls discharge to channels or basins (outflow)

Step 3: Documentation and Learning Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- FLO-2D provides built-in documentation:


    **Storm Drain Editor Manual**

- Located in the installation directory under ``FLO-2D > Manuals`` or via the **book icon** in the editor.
- Key Chapters:
  - Chapter 2: Inlet data types
  - Chapter 3: Output file structure
  - Chapter 4: Setup guidelines
  - Chapter 5: Troubleshooting
  - Chapter 6: How to review your storm drain model


  **Advanced Tutorial**
  - Found on YouTube under the *New Self-Help Kit* playlist

  **EPA SWMM GUI**
  - Installed alongside FLO-2D
  - Use for pump setups, advanced SWMM elements, and additional documentation

  **OpenSWMM.org**
  - A knowledge base and community forum with examples, questions, and shared resources.

  **ChatGPT**
  - Use ChatGPT (3.5 or 4.0) to assist with modeling questions or examples
  - For example: "Build a SWMM example with a pump" will generate a valid ``.inp`` file


Step 4: Contact Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lesson explains how to review and interpret inlet and junction shapefile data for storm drain modeling in FLO-2D.

Step 1: Storm Drain Feature Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Point features** (nodes): inlets, junctions, manholes, outfalls, storage units
- **Polyline features** (links): conduits, pumps, orifices

Inlet and junction nodes contain attributes that define how they interact with the grid and storm drain network.

Step 2: Documentation References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use the **Storm Drain Editor Manual** (Chapter 2) to understand inlet types:
  - Type 0: Junction (no interaction with surface)
  - Type 1: Curb opening
  - Type 2: Curb with gutter
  - Type 3: Grate
  - Type 4: Unique (e.g. headwall)
  - Type 5: Manhole

Step 3: Reviewing Node Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the shapefile table for inlets and junctions in QGIS.

- **Required attributes** (vary by type):
  - ``Name``: Must start with "I" for inlets
  - ``Type``: Integer (0 to 5)
  - ``Elevation``: Invert elevation
  - ``Max Depth``: From surface to invert
  - ``Length``, ``Width``, ``Perimeter``, ``Area``, ``Height``: As required per type
  - ``Weir Coefficient``
  - ``Feature Switch``: 0 (rim), 1 (invert), or 2 (special conditions)
  - Optional: ``Curb Height``, ``Clog Factor``, ``Clog Time``, ``Dropbox Area``

Step 4: Understanding Specific Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Type 0: Junction**
- No surface interaction
- Requires only invert elevation and max depth

**Type 1: Curb Opening**
- Requires: Length, Height, Weir Coefficient
- Does not include sag or width

**Type 2: Curb with Gutter**
- Requires: Length, Width (sag), Height, Weir Coefficient
- Optional: Curb Height, Dropbox Area

**Type 3: Grate**
- Requires: Perimeter, Area, Sag (optional), Weir Coefficient
- Often used in depressed road areas

**Type 4: Unique (Headwall)**
- Requires: Invert Elevation, Max Depth
- ``Feature Switch = 1`` sets grid elevation to invert
- Used for channel interfaces or direct inflow control

**Type 5: Manhole**
- Requires: Invert Elevation, Max Depth, Perimeter, Area, Surcharge Depth, Weir Coefficient
- Acts like a junction until surcharge pops the lid
- Allows bidirectional flow once popped

Step 5: Visualization Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use **categorized symbology** to color nodes by inlet type
- Use **Zoom to Feature** and satellite imagery to verify node alignment
- Position nodes carefully relative to grid elements for accurate simulation

Step 6: Unit Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All dimensions in **feet**
- Clogging factor is a **percentage (0-1)**
- Clogging time is in **hours**

Wrap-up
-------
This lesson focused on how to interpret and verify inlet and junction attributes using shapefile data. Proper definition ensures realistic storm drain and surface flow interactions.

Node Overview - Outfall, Storage Unit

This lesson explains how to review and configure outfalls and storage units in your storm drain shapefiles.

Outfalls
--------

Outfalls are point features representing discharge points from the storm drain network. To open the outfall data:

- Right-click the **Outfalls** layer and select **Open Attribute Table**.
- Dock the table for convenience.

Key Attributes for Outfalls:

- **Name**: Should begin with "O" (e.g., `O1`, `O2`) for clarity.
- **Invert Elevation**: Elevation where flow exits.
- **Flap Gate**: `True` or `False`. Controls whether backflow is allowed.
- **Allow Q**: `1` = yes, interfaces with FLO-2D; `0` = no interface.
- **Outfall Type**: Options include:
  - `FREE`: Free discharge
  - `NORMAL`: Controlled by downstream conditions
  - `FIXED`: Fixed stage elevation
  - `TIDAL_CURVE`: Elevation changes with time
  - `TIME_SERIES`: Stage varies over time

.. note::
   When connecting an outfall to a channel, always assign it to the **left bank looking downstream**, even if physically placed on the right.

Examples:
- Outfalls located outside the grid should have `Allow Q` set to `0`.
- Tidal or fixed outfalls must define a corresponding elevation, curve, or time series.

Storage Units
-------------

Storage units in FLO-2D are used for **closed systems** like tanks or underground vaults.

Open the **Storage Units** layer:
- Right-click and select **Open Attribute Table**
- Dock the table for visibility

Valid Attributes for Storage Units:

- **Name**: Unique identifier
- **Invert Elevation**: Bottom elevation of the storage unit
- **Max Depth**: Maximum storage depth
- **Initial Depth** *(optional)*
- **Storage Curve**: Define a depth-volume relationship (tabular curve only)

Unsupported Features:

- No **infiltration**, **evaporation**, or **ponded area**
- These values must exist in the `.inp` file but can be left blank or zero

.. note::
   FLO-2D does not support surface ponding or infiltration via storage units. Use the grid system for those interactions.

Where to Learn More
-------------------

- Check the **Storm Drain Manual** for outfall and storage unit setup
- Use the **EPA SWMM GUI** to understand field definitions
- FLO-2D only uses closed storage systems in the storm drain module

This lesson focuses on configuring **conduits** in the storm drain system. Conduits are polylines that connect nodes (e.g., inlets, junctions, outfalls), and are fully stored in the `.inp` file without an associated FLO-2D file.

Open and Review the Conduit Attribute Table
-------------------------------------------
1. In QGIS, right-click on the **Conduits** layer and choose **Open Attribute Table**.
2. Dock the table to work alongside the map.
3. Note that conduits:
   - Do not generate `.dat` files like `SWMMFLOW.DAT` or `SWMMOUTF.DAT`.
   - Are entirely represented in the **SWMM .inp file**.

Key Fields and Attributes
-------------------------
The following fields should be configured in the conduit shapefile:

+------------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+


.. note::
   Use the **Storm Drain Editor manual** or **SWMM GUI Help** to reference proper field definitions and recommended values.

Tips on Flow Direction
----------------------
- Flow direction is determined by the digitized order of the polyline.
- Use the **Advanced Digitizing Toolbar** in QGIS to flip flow direction with the **Reverse Line** tool.
- Turn on **arrow symbology** to visualize flow direction:
  - Right-click layer > Symbology > Line Symbol > Arrow

.. tip::
   Reversing a line also reverses all internal vertices, keeping topology intact.

Checking Profiles and Connectivity
----------------------------------
Use the **Profile Tool** to visualize elevation and connectivity:
1. Select a starting node and ending node.
2. Plot the conduit profile.
3. Observe invert elevations and slope direction.
4. Check for backward conduits or improper connections.

Minimum Length Guidelines
-------------------------
To maintain model stability:
- The **minimum conduit length** should match or exceed the grid cell size.
- For urban grids (typically 20 to 30 ft), no conduit should be shorter than the grid resolution.

.. code-block:: python

   # Example: Reset all conduits with length < 20 to 20
   length < 20 â†’ update to 20

Setting Styles by Attributes
----------------------------
To visually inspect your network:
- Use graduated symbology on conduit `length` or `geom1` (diameter).
- Classify using color ramps for clearer mapping.

Loss Coefficients and Flap Gates
--------------------------------
- Reference **SWMM GUI Help > Losses** for entrance/exit coefficient ranges.
- **Flap Gate** set to 1 prevents backflow.

.. important::
   Entry/exit losses are applied to simulate energy loss at junctions and transitions.

Final Notes
-----------
- Conduits form the backbone of your storm drain system.
- Digitizing accuracy and attribute completeness are critical.
- Double-check names, flow directions, and invert elevations.
