Storm drain checklist.

For those of you who love a challenge, it's good practice to do a "Speed Run" of the Self-Help
Kit.  Here is a checklist of tasks that might get skipped during storm drain model building.

- [ ] Adjust outfall location so all outfalls rest on a left bank node.
- [ ] Add a storage unit volume table and assign `Storage1` to all storage units.
- [ ] Ensure conduit length is a minimum of 30 ft, which is the cell size.
- [ ] Add Type 4 rating tables to the Type 4 inlets.
- [ ] Add a pump table and assign it to `P1`.
- [ ] Auto-assign nodes.
- [ ] Carefully inspect shapefile fields.
- [ ] Check storm drain control settings.
- [ ] Schematize the network.
- [ ] Perform a test run.

This lesson provides an introduction to importing and understanding the storm drain system in FLO-2D using QGIS.

Step 1: Import Storm Drain Shapefiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Load storm drain shapefiles into your project.
- Sort files by type and select those labeled as **shapefiles**.
- Drag and drop into a **Storm Drain** group in your QGIS layer panel.

Step 2: Understanding FLO-2D Storm Drain Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- FLO-2D handles most drainage through the **surface model**:
  - Channels and detention basins are modeled at the surface.
  - Inlets and outfalls interface with the surface system.

.. note::
   You do **not** need subcatchments, rain gauges, or separate infiltration models like in SWMM.

- Storm drains receive water from:
  - Streets and inlets (inflow)
  - Outfalls discharge to channels or basins (outflow)

Step 3: Documentation and Learning Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- FLO-2D provides built-in documentation:


    **Storm Drain Editor Manual**

- Located in the installation directory under ``FLO-2D > Manuals`` or via the **book icon** in the editor.
- Key Chapters:
  - Chapter 2: Inlet data types
  - Chapter 3: Output file structure
  - Chapter 4: Setup guidelines
  - Chapter 5: Troubleshooting
  - Chapter 6: How to review your storm drain model


  **Advanced Tutorial**
  - Found on YouTube under the *New Self-Help Kit* playlist

  **EPA SWMM GUI**
  - Installed alongside FLO-2D
  - Use for pump setups, advanced SWMM elements, and additional documentation

  **OpenSWMM.org**
  - A knowledge base and community forum with examples, questions, and shared resources.

  **ChatGPT**
  - Use ChatGPT (3.5 or 4.0) to assist with modeling questions or examples
  - For example: "Build a SWMM example with a pump" will generate a valid ``.inp`` file

This lesson explains how to review and interpret inlet and junction shapefile data for storm drain modeling in FLO-2D.

Step 1: Storm Drain Feature Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Point features** (nodes): inlets, junctions, manholes, outfalls, storage units
- **Polyline features** (links): conduits, pumps, orifices

Inlet and junction nodes contain attributes that define how they interact with the grid and storm drain network.

Step 2: Documentation References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use the **Storm Drain Editor Manual** (Chapter 2) to understand inlet types:
  - Type 0: Junction (no interaction with surface)
  - Type 1: Curb opening
  - Type 2: Curb with gutter
  - Type 3: Grate
  - Type 4: Unique (e.g. headwall)
  - Type 5: Manhole

Step 3: Reviewing Node Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the shapefile table for inlets and junctions in QGIS.

- **Required attributes** (vary by type):
  - ``Name``: Must start with "I" for inlets
  - ``Type``: Integer (0 to 5)
  - ``Elevation``: Invert elevation
  - ``Max Depth``: From surface to invert
  - ``Length``, ``Width``, ``Perimeter``, ``Area``, ``Height``: As required per type
  - ``Weir Coefficient``
  - ``Feature Switch``: 0 (rim), 1 (invert), or 2 (special conditions)
  - Optional: ``Curb Height``, ``Clog Factor``, ``Clog Time``, ``Dropbox Area``

Step 4: Understanding Specific Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Type 0: Junction**
- No surface interaction
- Requires only invert elevation and max depth

**Type 1: Curb Opening**
- Requires: Length, Height, Weir Coefficient
- Does not include sag or width

**Type 2: Curb with Gutter**
- Requires: Length, Width (sag), Height, Weir Coefficient
- Optional: Curb Height, Dropbox Area

**Type 3: Grate**
- Requires: Perimeter, Area, Sag (optional), Weir Coefficient
- Often used in depressed road areas

**Type 4: Unique (Headwall)**
- Requires: Invert Elevation, Max Depth
- ``Feature Switch = 1`` sets grid elevation to invert
- Used for channel interfaces or direct inflow control

**Type 5: Manhole**
- Requires: Invert Elevation, Max Depth, Perimeter, Area, Surcharge Depth, Weir Coefficient
- Acts like a junction until surcharge pops the lid
- Allows bidirectional flow once popped

Step 5: Visualization Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use **categorized symbology** to color nodes by inlet type
- Use **Zoom to Feature** and satellite imagery to verify node alignment
- Position nodes carefully relative to grid elements for accurate simulation

Step 6: Unit Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All dimensions in **feet**
- Clogging factor is a **percentage (0-1)**
- Clogging time is in **hours**

Wrap-up
-------
This lesson focused on how to interpret and verify inlet and junction attributes using shapefile data. Proper definition ensures realistic storm drain and surface flow interactions.

Node Overview - Outfall, Storage Unit

This lesson explains how to review and configure outfalls and storage units in your storm drain shapefiles.

Outfalls
--------

Outfalls are point features representing discharge points from the storm drain network. To open the outfall data:

- Right-click the **Outfalls** layer and select **Open Attribute Table**.
- Dock the table for convenience.

Key Attributes for Outfalls:

- **Name**: Should begin with "O" (e.g., `O1`, `O2`) for clarity.
- **Invert Elevation**: Elevation where flow exits.
- **Flap Gate**: `True` or `False`. Controls whether backflow is allowed.
- **Allow Q**: `1` = yes, interfaces with FLO-2D; `0` = no interface.
- **Outfall Type**: Options include:
  - `FREE`: Free discharge
  - `NORMAL`: Controlled by downstream conditions
  - `FIXED`: Fixed stage elevation
  - `TIDAL_CURVE`: Elevation changes with time
  - `TIME_SERIES`: Stage varies over time

.. note::
   When connecting an outfall to a channel, always assign it to the **left bank looking downstream**, even if physically placed on the right.

Examples:
- Outfalls located outside the grid should have `Allow Q` set to `0`.
- Tidal or fixed outfalls must define a corresponding elevation, curve, or time series.

Storage Units
-------------

Storage units in FLO-2D are used for **closed systems** like tanks or underground vaults.

Open the **Storage Units** layer:
- Right-click and select **Open Attribute Table**
- Dock the table for visibility

Valid Attributes for Storage Units:

- **Name**: Unique identifier
- **Invert Elevation**: Bottom elevation of the storage unit
- **Max Depth**: Maximum storage depth
- **Initial Depth** *(optional)*
- **Storage Curve**: Define a depth-volume relationship (tabular curve only)

Unsupported Features:

- No **infiltration**, **evaporation**, or **ponded area**
- These values must exist in the `.inp` file but can be left blank or zero

.. note::
   FLO-2D does not support surface ponding or infiltration via storage units. Use the grid system for those interactions.

Where to Learn More
-------------------

- Check the **Storm Drain Manual** for outfall and storage unit setup
- Use the **EPA SWMM GUI** to understand field definitions
- FLO-2D only uses closed storage systems in the storm drain module

Link Overview - Conduit
-----------------------------

This lesson focuses on configuring **conduits** in the storm drain system. Conduits are polylines that connect nodes (e.g., inlets, junctions, outfalls), and are fully stored in the `.inp` file without an associated FLO-2D file.

Open and Review the Conduit Attribute Table
-------------------------------------------
1. In QGIS, right-click on the **Conduits** layer and choose **Open Attribute Table**.
2. Dock the table to work alongside the map.
3. Note that conduits:
   - Do not generate `.dat` files like `SWMMFLOW.DAT` or `SWMMOUTF.DAT`.
   - Are entirely represented in the **SWMM .inp file**.

Key Fields and Attributes
-------------------------
The following fields should be configured in the conduit shapefile:

+------------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Field Name             | Type           | Description                                 |

+------------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+


.. note::
   Use the **Storm Drain Editor manual** or **SWMM GUI Help** to reference proper field definitions and recommended values.

Tips on Flow Direction
----------------------
- Flow direction is determined by the digitized order of the polyline.
- Use the **Advanced Digitizing Toolbar** in QGIS to flip flow direction with the **Reverse Line** tool.
- Turn on **arrow symbology** to visualize flow direction:
  - Right-click layer > Symbology > Line Symbol > Arrow

.. tip::
   Reversing a line also reverses all internal vertices, keeping topology intact.

Checking Profiles and Connectivity
----------------------------------
Use the **Profile Tool** to visualize elevation and connectivity:
1. Select a starting node and ending node.
2. Plot the conduit profile.
3. Observe invert elevations and slope direction.
4. Check for backward conduits or improper connections.

Minimum Length Guidelines
-------------------------
To maintain model stability:
- The **minimum conduit length** should match or exceed the grid cell size.
- For urban grids (typically 20 to 30 ft), no conduit should be shorter than the grid resolution.

.. code-block:: python

   # Example: Reset all conduits with length < 20 to 20
   length < 20 = update to 20

Setting Styles by Attributes
----------------------------
To visually inspect your network:
- Use graduated symbology on conduit `length` or `geom1` (diameter).
- Classify using color ramps for clearer mapping.

Loss Coefficients and Flap Gates
--------------------------------
- Reference **SWMM GUI Help > Losses** for entrance/exit coefficient ranges.
- **Flap Gate** set to 1 prevents backflow.

.. important::
   Entry/exit losses are applied to simulate energy loss at junctions and transitions.

Final Notes
-----------
- Conduits form the backbone of your storm drain system.
- Digitizing accuracy and attribute completeness are critical.
- Double-check names, flow directions, and invert elevations.

This lesson walks through building an entire storm drain system from shapefiles, defining rating tables, storage units, and pump curves, and then running the simulation.

Step 1: Load Shapefiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Open the **Advanced Storm Drain Layers** folder.
- Drag and drop the appropriate shapefiles into QGIS.
- Do **not** add them to the GeoPackage. Keep them in the User Layers.
- Save when prompted and select **Yes** to embed data into the GeoPackage for portability.

Step 2: Assign Shapefile Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the **Storm Drain Editor** and click **Select Components from Shapefile**.

- Point layers like inlets, outfalls, and storage units will show up in the dropdown.
- Assign each required field from the shapefile attributes:
  - Example: `Inlet Name` â†’ `name`, `Type` â†’ `type`, etc.
- Turn off unused or null-value fields to avoid unnecessary entries.

Step 3: Assign Nodes to Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click the **Auto-Assign Links and Nodes** button.

- This assigns start and end nodes to each conduit.
- Uses the closest node within a 3-ft radius from the first and last vertex of a conduit.

.. warning::
   - Make sure conduit directions are correct using the **Reverse Line Tool** in the **Advanced Digitizing Toolbar**.
   - Use the **Snapping Tool** to ensure precise vertex-node connections.

Step 4: Add Type 4 Rating Tables and Culverts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Go to the **Type 4 Table Editor**.
- Import rating tables or culvert equations for each type 4 inlet.
- File names must match inlet names (e.g., ``41.txt`` for inlet 41).
- Format for rating tables: Depth on the left, Discharge on the right.

Step 5: Add Pump Curve Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add a pump curve via the Pump Table interface.
- Name it to match the pump (e.g., ``P1``).
- Enter a depth-discharge pair (e.g., ``1,10``, ``2,20``).
- Data is saved automatically when you click off the cell.

Step 6: Add Storage Unit Curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Open **Storage Units** attribute table.
- Use the **FLO-2D Info Tool** to open the storage curve editor.
- Import a tab-delimited text file or paste Excel values.

Step 7: Set Storm Drain Control Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Set the **start and end time** of your simulation (e.g., 10 hours).
- Ensure it matches any time series used.
- Adjust the **report step**, **flow units** (CFS/CMS), and **routing method**.
- Leave advanced defaults unless needed.

Step 8: Schematize and Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Click **Schematize Storm Drain** to export ``SWMM.OUTF``, ``SWMM.FLOW``, ``DROPBOX.DAT``, etc.
- Click **Quick Run** to simulate.
- Output files will populate your designated folder.

.. tip::
   If errors occur, check your shapefile connections, field assignments, or go to a **FLO-2D Troubleshooting** video in the series.
