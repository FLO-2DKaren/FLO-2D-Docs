Layers that work with this tool:

-  Channel layers

-  Left bank

-  Cross sections

-  Structure layers

-  Levee layers

This tool is a toggle.  Toggle it on to activate it and toggle it off to stop using it.

Channel Profiles
----------------

1. Click  
   the FLO-2D Info Tool.

4. Use the  
   Profile Tool widget to select the data plot source.

5. In this example, the  
   elevation raster is the y axis and the left bank length is the x axis.
