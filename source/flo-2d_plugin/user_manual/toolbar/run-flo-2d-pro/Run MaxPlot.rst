Run MaxPlot
===================

MaxPlot is a post-processor  program  to  display  spatially  variable  results  and
perform difference calculations.

.. note:: Maxplot is a simple and fast tool for plotting results.  For more comprehensive map making, use
   MapCrafter or Rasterizor plugins.

.. note:: The project folder must have a CONT.DAT and \*.OUT files to run MaxPlot. It is also possible to run
   Maxplot from the Project folder but it must also have the same \*.DLL files that are used by FLOPRO.EXE because
   Maxplot uses OpenMP multiple processor code dlls.
