FLO-2D Plugin Settings
========================

.. important:: To ensure proper execution of executables/plugins, it is essential to install the executables in the
               correct FLO-2D folder, the plugins in QGIS, and configure the paths accurately within the
               FLO-2D Plugin Settings.

The FLO-2D Plugin Settings tool has several functions:

- Define the simulation path.

- Connect to simulation results.

- Start a Debug run.

- Show hidden layers.

Define Simulation Path
------------------------

1. Click on the
   FLO-2D Plugin Settings tool button.

.. note:: The default path is: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\FLO-2D PRO"

4. Click OK to select the FLO-2D PRO folder.

5. Click on the button to select the FLO-2D Project folder.

.. note:: This is the folder where FLO-2D PRO is going to run and generate the \*.OUT files.

6. Click OK select the FLO-2D Project folder.

7. Click OK to save the settings.

.. note:: The FLO-2D Project folder is updated everytime that files are exported. Double check the FLO-2D Project folder
          prior running a simulation.

Connect to Results
------------------------

Follow the same method shown in Define Simulation Path to connect the FLO-2D Plugin to Simulation results.

Once the
plugin is connected to a folder with a completed simulation, a project review system is activated.

See more info on this system here: :ref:`FLO-2D Results <flo-2d_results_tool>`


Start a Debug Run
------------------------

See `Debug Tool <../flo-2d-project-review/Debug.html>`__ for the Debug Run.

Show Hidden Layers
---------------------

The FLO-2D Plugin v1.0.0 and later hides layers that do not need to be viewed by most end users.  However, it is
possible to show these layers for troubleshooting purposes.

Uncheck the checkbox to hide the layers again.
