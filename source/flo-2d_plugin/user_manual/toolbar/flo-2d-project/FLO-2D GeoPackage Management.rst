FLO-2D GeoPackage Management
=============================

The FLO-2D GeoPackage Management tool allows users to delete layers added to the GeoPackage.
Whether a layer is too heavy or was added mistakenly, this tool facilitates efficient maintenance of a
well-structured GeoPackage.

.. note::  The layers that can be deleted are layers that were added by the user. The layers required by
           FLO-2D are not allowed to be deleted and, therefore, are not shown on the FLO-2D GeoPackage Management
           window.

GeoPackage Structure
-------------------------------------------

.. warning:: Do not delete layers that are part of the native GeoPackage structure.  This will break the project.
   Perform a backup prior to modifying a geopackage with sqlite tools.  Sqlite is a powerful and easy way to perform
   database modification.  Just be careful.

1. View a GeoPackage Structure using the QGIS Browser panel.
