Grid Tools
================

Grid tools are used to sample various datatypes to the grid.  It employs methods such as vector intersection to the grid
layer and raster warp to the grid layer.  The processes can use External data such as elevation files or data layers
that are part of the geopackage.  Each tool is described in this section.
