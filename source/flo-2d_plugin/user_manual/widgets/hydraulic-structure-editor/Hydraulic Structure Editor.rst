Overview
--------

The Hydraulic Structure Editor provides a graphical user interface for defining and managing hydraulic structures within the FLO-2D Plugin. These structures control the movement of water between grid elements and are essential for simulating culverts, bridges, weirs, storm drains, and pumps in both floodplain and channel systems.

The editor supports all structure types and configurations available in FLO-2D, including:

- Floodplain-to-floodplain culverts using rating curves or culvert equations
- Channel-to-channel hydraulic structures with optional replacement curves
- Floodplain-to-channel and channel-to-floodplain interactions
- Complex bridge hydraulics using detailed coefficient tables
- Pump systems and simplified storm drain configurations

Purpose
~~~~~~~~~

Hydraulic structures simulate the effect of physical features that convey, restrict, or redirect flow between nodes. The purpose of the editor is to simplify the process of:

- Assigning node connections (inlet and outlet)
- Specifying flow control methods (rating curve, culvert routine, bridge routine, etc.)
- Entering reference elevations, coefficients, and geometric dimensions
- Configuring optional features such as tailwater effects, structure blockage, or deck overtopping
- Previewing structure behavior using visual layout and tooltip guidance

By using the editor, users can ensure structure inputs are consistent with FLO-2D model requirements and avoid common mistakes like mismatched node types or incomplete variable assignments. Each structure is validated in the UI before being saved to the `HYSTRUC.DAT` file, improving simulation reliability and workflow efficiency.

.. note:: An advanced tutorial for modeling hydraulic structures and culverts is available on the Gila Self-Help Tutorials.

Structure Hydraulic Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr007.png


**Hydraulic Control**

Select the hydraulic control method that governs flow through the structure. The options correspond to different modeling approaches in FLO-2D:

1. **Rating curve** – Defines flow using a depth vs. discharge equation.
2. **Rating table** – Defines flow using a depth vs. discharge table.
3. **Culvert equation** – Uses empirical culvert equations to calculate flow based on geometry and headwater conditions.
4. **Bridge routine** – Applies a specialized bridge flow routine based on physical dimensions and flow coefficients.


**Load Rating Tables**  

Click the **Import Rating Tables** button to load pre-defined rating data into the model.

Tailwater Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr006.png

Tailwater control settings determine how downstream water levels affect culvert discharge. These options are used to simulate varying degrees of backwater influence or flow reversal at the culvert outlet:

- **No tail water effect – discharge based on headwater**  
  Assumes free outfall conditions. Discharge is computed solely from upstream headwater elevation. No upstream flow allowed.

- **Reduced discharge and NO upstream flow allowed**  
  Simulates partial submergence. Discharge is reduced based on downstream conditions, but reverse flow from outlet to inlet is not permitted. 
  This condition is similar to a flap gate.

- **Reduced discharge and upstream flow allowed**  
  Allows for backflow into the upstream system under high tailwater conditions. Discharge is still reduced due to submergence.

.. note::  
   Tailwater settings simulate how downstream conditions influence flow through the structure. 
   Use these controls when submergence or flow reversal is expected due to backwater conditions, 
   particularly in urban or complex drainage systems.

Simple Storm Drain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr008.png

.. warning:: Use this option sparingly. The hierarchy of flow through this system is not applied appropriately for use on more than 2 or 3 inlets.

**Storm Drain Capacity**  

- This tool provides a simplified method for linking multiple inlets to a single outlet using a maximum discharge threshold.
- Only compatible with rating table structures.
- Not intended to model full pipe networks. It is useful when detailed storm drain routing is unavailable or unnecessary.
- The capacity value (cfs or cms) sets the maximum allowable flow. If inflow exceeds this value, excess water will pond at the inlet(s).

Structure Parameters II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr009.png

These parameters are used when defining culvert or conduit characteristics for hydraulic rating calculations:

- **Reference Elevation for Headwater**  
  Specifies the minimum upstream water elevation required to initiate flow through the structure. 
  Flow will not occur until the water level reaches this elevation.

- **Culvert or Conduit Length**  

  If the structure does not use a long culvert or culvert equation, enter **0.0** for length and diameter.

  **Culvert Equation**
  
  Defines the total length of the culvert (ft or m). Apply this length when using the **culvert equation** method.

  **Long Culvert**

   If the structure length exceeds 500 ft (150 m), it is considered a *long culvert*. In this case:

   - A **rating table** must be used.
   - The **flow area** must be defined (using `ATABLE` or related variables).
   - Long culverts simulate **storage** and **travel time**, unlike other structures that convey flow instantaneously.

**Circular Diameter or Box Culvert Height**

If the structure does not use a long culvert or culvert equation, enter **0.0** for both length and diameter.

Defines the internal size of the culvert (ft or m).

**Culvert Equation**

- For **circular culverts**, enter the **internal diameter**.
- For **box culverts**, enter the **internal height**.

**Long Culvert**

- Use **diameter only** for flow area calculations.
- Must be paired with **culvert length** and **area table**.
- Only compatible with **rating table** structures.

Table Editor and Plot
-------------------------------

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr010.png

The Table Editor and Plot section defines the rating relationships or hydraulic parameters associated with the selected structure type. Each configuration corresponds to variables in the `HYSTRUC.DAT` input file.

**Rating Curve Table Editor**

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr011.png

The Rating Curve Table Editor is used to define the structure’s flow behavior using headwater-dependent equations. Each column corresponds to a variable in the `HYSTRUC.DAT` file. These parameters are described in detail in the Data Input Manual and are used in combinations based on the selected structure type.

.. list-table:: Rating Curve Table Columns
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Description
   * - HDEPEXC
     - Maximum headwater depth valid for the rating curve.
   * - COEFQ, EXPQ
     - Discharge equation: Q = COEFQ * depth^EXPQ
   * - COEFA, EXPA
     - Area equation for long culverts: A = COEFA * depth^EXPA
   * - REPDEP
     - Depth at which to switch to a replacement curve.
   * - RQCOEF, RQEXP
     - Discharge equation for replacement curve.
   * - RACOEF, RAEXP
     - Area equation for replacement curve (long culverts only).

See the :ref:`HYSTRUC.DAT <data_input_manual>` section of the Data Input Manual for complete parameter descriptions and valid input ranges.

**Rating Table**

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr013.png

The rating table method defines flow through the structure using headwater depth (`HDEPTH`) and corresponding discharge (`QTABLE`). 
FLO-2D applies linear interpolation between rows to estimate the flow rate for any given depth during the simulation.

- `HDEPTH` – Headwater depth above the structure reference elevation (ft or m).
- `QTABLE` – Discharge value associated with each headwater depth (cfs or cms).
- `ATABLE` – (Optional) Cross-sectional flow area vs depth (ft\ :sup:`2` or m\ :sup:`2`) used in volume routing for long culverts. Enter **0.0** if not applicable.

The adjacent plot updates automatically and displays the rating curve graphically as depth vs. discharge. 
Ensure the first entry begins with `HDEPTH = 0.0` and `QTABLE = 0.0` to allow proper interpolation between the first two rows.

.. tip::
   This method is commonly used for culverts, weirs, and other structures where detailed hydraulic calculations have already been performed externally or measured in the field.

**Culvert Equation**

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr014.png

The culvert equation method computes flow using geometric and frictional parameters defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation equations. This table allows input of the following:

- `TYPEC` – Culvert shape: 1 = box, 2 = pipe  
- `TYPEEN` – Entrance configuration (1–3 based on shape)  
- `CULVERTN` – Manning’s n-value for internal culvert roughness  
- `KE` – Entrance loss coefficient  
- `CUBASE` – Width of the box culvert or set to 0 for circular culverts  
- `MULTBARRELS` – Number of identical culvert barrels or cells

These parameters are used to estimate flow under both inlet and outlet control conditions. 
For additional guidance on selecting values and entrance types, refer to the :ref:`Culvert Equation Data <culvert_equation_data>` section.


**Bridge Routine**

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydr015.png

The bridge routine provides a detailed method for modeling flow through bridge openings using upstream and downstream cross sections and coefficient-based flow equations derived from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research.

This configuration allows input of:

This table defines the upstream and downstream cross sections used in the bridge routine. Cross section geometry is entered as station-elevation points along the bridge profile:

- `XUP`, `YUP` – Station of each cross section point
- `YUP` – Elevation of the upstream cross section.
- `YB` – Elevation of the corresponding downstream point at the same station

The table must define a continuous profile across the full bridge opening, including abutments, channel bed, and any roadway or deck geometry. The plotted cross section provides a visual check of the entered values.

These cross sections are used by the bridge routine in conjunction with flow coefficients and structure parameters (e.g., pier width, low chord elevation) to compute flow through the bridge.

.. note::
   For a complete example showing how to use this table along with the bridge coefficients and geometry fields, refer to the :ref:`Bridge Example <bridge_example>` in the Examples section.

Bridge Data
----------------

Bridge parameters can be defined for a structure.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau020.png


The USGS bridge tables are used to define the flow though a bridge with bridge geometry and discharge coefficients.

.. note:: See `Bridge tutorial and Bridge guidelines <https://documentation.flo-2d.com/Advanced-Lessons/Module%202%20Part%203.html>`__ for a detailed guide.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau021.png

Example Hydraulic Structures
--------------------------------

.. note:: These examples show the final configuration only.  For step by step instructions see the :ref:`Self Help Tutorials <structure_example>` 

Floodplain to Floodplain Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Floodplain to Floodplain
-  Rating Table

This example will model a culvert system between two floodplain nodes.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau008.png

The floodplain structure uses the grid element elevation as it's inlet and outlet invert elevations.
In this case the inlet invert is 177.24 ft and the outlet invert is 174.13 ft.

.. note:: Because culverts have a headwall, the grid elevation may need an adjustment down to the invert.  The advanced
   culvert tutorial in the Self Help Kit shows how to make that elevation correction.  :ref:`Self Help Tutorials <correct_elevation>` 

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau010.png

- This structure is a floodplain to floodplain culvert that uses a rating table.
- It has a headwater control so the Tailwater switch is set to "0" or No tailwater effect.  
- It does not have a reference elevation for headwater so the flow starts at the invert elevation.  
- It's not considered a long culvert so the length and diameter are both "0.00".

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau012.png


The rating table is a headwater control rating table.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau013.png

Channel to Channel Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Channel to Channel
-  Generalized Culvert Equation

This structure will simulate discharge through a box culvert.
This example has a box culvert that is longer than the grid element.
The channel segments are split up to allow for the width of the roadway.


.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/addchanculv.gif



.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau002.png

Table

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau006.png


   
Floodplain to Channel Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Floodplain to Channel
-  Culvert equation

This example shows a culvert that connects a basin to a channel laterally.

.. important:: The structure always connects to left bank of a channel regardless of which bank the structure is positioned on.  
   This is because the structure connects to the cross section and the reference point is always the left bank grid element number.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau014.png

- The culvert is assigned to the channel cross section.
- That is why the feature must be applied to a left bank channel node.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau015.png

- The culvert length is 118ft.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau016.png

- This is a pedestrian crossing so the culvert height must be at least 8 ft.
- The width of the structure is approximately 12 ft.
- There are 30-degree wingwalls.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau017.png

- The stage of the water in the channel will result in a tailwater control.
- The tailwater switch should be set to Reduced Discharge and upstream flow allowed.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/Hydrau018.png

The remaining culvert parameters are defined in the Table Editor.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydex004.png

- **TYPEC** =  1 (box) 
- **TYPEEN** = 1 (wingwall flare)
- **CULVERTN** = 0.020
- **KE** 0.5 (wingwall and square edge)
- **CUBASE** = 12 ft (width)
- **MULTBARRELS** = 1 (single-barrel)

**Culvert Type Switch**

The culvert shape is defined using the `TYPEC(I)` variable:

- ``1`` = Box culvert
- ``2`` = Pipe culvert

**Box Entrance Types (TYPEEN)**

- ``1`` – Wingwall flare 30° to 75°
- ``2`` – Wingwall flare 90° or 15°
- ``3`` – Wingwall flare 0°

**Box Losses**

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydex005.png

Channel to Floodplain Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Channel to Floodplain
-  Culvert equation

This example has a channel to floodplain box culvert on the downstream side. 
The example will not outline the the floodplain to channel circular culvert on the upstream side.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydex001.png

The channel to floodplain culvert is a box culvert with a sedimentation weir on the upstream side.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydex003.png


- This structure is a channel to floodplain culvert that uses a culvert equation.
- It has a headwater control so the tailwater switch is set to "0" or No tailwater effect.  
- It has a sedimentation weir so the reference elevation for headwater is 1396.63.  
- It needs a culvert length 100.00 ft and a culvert height 5.00 ft because it uses the culvert equation.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydex002.png

The remaining culvert parameters are defined in the Table Editor.

.. image:: ../../img/Hydraulic-Structure-Editor/hydex004.png

- **TYPEC** =  1 (box) 
- **TYPEEN** = 1 (wingwall flare)
- **CULVERTN** = 0.018
- **KE** 0.4 (wingwall and square edge)
- **CUBASE** = 8 ft (width)
- **MULTBARRELS** = 1 (single-barrel)

**Culvert Type Switch**

The culvert shape is defined using the `TYPEC(I)` variable:

- ``1`` = Box culvert
- ``2`` = Pipe culvert

**Box Entrance Types (TYPEEN)**

- ``1`` – Wingwall flare 30° to 75°
- ``2`` – Wingwall flare 90° or 15°
- ``3`` – Wingwall flare 0°

**Box Losses**
