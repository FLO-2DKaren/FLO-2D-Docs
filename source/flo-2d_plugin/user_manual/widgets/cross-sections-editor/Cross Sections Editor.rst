Digitize Banks
------------------

Left Bank
___________

1. Select the
   Left Bank Line layer.

2. Click on both the start  
   editing button and the add feature button.

3. Create a polyline to  
   represent the left bank looking downstream and click to save the layer.

4. It is important to  
   create the segments from order upstream to downstream.

5. Tributaries or  
   split channels should be created once the main channels are complete.

   the all the various channel segments and save.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User007.png


Digitize Cross Sections
-------------------------

Build Cross Sections
_______________________

To create natural cross sections, the cross sections should be numbered consecutively from upstream to downstream for
each channel segment.

.. note:: - Draw polylines from left bank to right bank looking downstream.
          - The first cross section must cross the left and right bank and be inside the same grid elements as the end
            points.
          - Each cross sections must cross the left and right bank.

1. Click the Add Cross
   sections lines button.

2. Digitize the cross  
   section on the map.

3. Name the cross section and  
   click OK to finish the feature.

4. Click save to complete  
   the process and load the data into the widget.

5. Repeat this process from upstream to down stream.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User008.png
  

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User009.png

The cross sections shown in the following image have been digitized.

The finished product will look something like the following image.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User010.png


Station Elevation
_________________________________________________

The preferred and easiest way to sample elevation data for a cross section is by using the FLO-2D Sample Elevation tool.
Once the cross sections are digitized onto the map, the Sample Elevation tools are used to sample elevation data from a
raster into Stations/Elevation
data sets for all or individual cross sections.

This section will focus on natural channel geometry (N type).

1. Set the elevation raster as  
   the Source Raster Layer and use either button to sample one or all cross sections.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User011.png

2. The station elevation data is  
   limited to the point where the left and right bank intersect the cross section.

3. If too much or too little data  
   has been sampled, adjust the left or right bank alignment and sample the elevation again.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User012.png


Schematize and Interpolate
----------------------------

Schematize
______________

1. Once the banks and cross sections are complete, the next step is to Schematize the channels.
   Click the Schematize button.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User013.png


2. Errors and warning will appear if  
   something is not configured correctly.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User014.png


3. At the beginning of each segment,  
   the left bank node, right bank node must be in the same cell as the end nodes on the cross sections.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User015.png
  

4. If the cross section does  
   not touch the left or right bank, the following message will appear.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User016.png

5. Correct this condition by  
   making sure each cross section crosses both banks.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User017.png

6. If the channel  
   schematize process was successful, the log message panel will report the schematize information.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User018.png

7. The schematized layers now have complete left bank, right bank, and cross section data.

.. note:: It is a good time to realign the left and right banks if they do not have good alignment.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User019.png


Interpolate
______________________

1. Inspect the cross section n-value field to ensure all n-values are present.
   If missing, fill the required n-value to the field.

2. Right click on the Cross Sections layer to open the Attribute Table.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User058.png


3. Click the interpolate button to run the interpolator.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User013.png

4. If the interpolation is performed correctly, the following message will appear.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User026.png


Troubleshooting cross sections
_______________________________

1. If a cross section data is bad, the interpolator will not run.  An error message may appear.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/user060.png

2. Check to see if the channel width is correct by running the clicking the channel check button.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User013.png

3. If the channel is not wide enough, a dialog box will load that allows the user to load the channel that needs to be
   widened.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/user059.png

4. Move the left or right bank further away from each other and run the schematize and interpolator again.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/user061.png


Prismatic Cross Sections
---------------------------

Prismatic channel data can be entered and interpolated using the cross section editor.
Use this option for creating Rectangular and Trapezoidal channel segments.
This example will use two segments of channel data.
One for a rectangular channel and one for a trapezoidal channel.

Rectangular Cross Sections

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User019.png

Sample Bank Data
___________________

There are many ways to edit the bank data for R and T type channels.
This section will show two different ways to create and correct bank elevation data.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User037.png


The bank elevation data can be sampled in two methods.

Method 1: Elevation from Grid
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The first method is from the Grid layer and the second is from the elevation Raster.

1. Click the From Grid
   radio button and select Individual or all cross sections to sample.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User038.png


The bank data is the reference point to determine the bed elevation of the channel so it can influence the profile.
For example, if one uses the grid element elevation to set the bank elevation, the channel profile is wrong.
The Grid method should only be used if a good raster is not available.

2. Click the channel profile tool
   and the left bank to check the profile of the channel.

.. image:: ../../img/Buttons/run005.png


.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User040.png


This is not the preferred method since a grid elevation for a grid is always somewhere in between the bank of the channel
and the internal channel
data.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User041.png


Method 2: Elevation from Raster
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This method is used if an elevation raster can be used to define the bank elevation.

1. Click the From Raster radio
   button and select Individual or all cross sections to sample.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User042.png


.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User043.png


Interpolate Prismatic
_________________________

1. Click the interpolate button to run the interpolator.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User013.png

2. If the interpolation is performed correctly, the following message will appear.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User026.png

3. An interplated prismatic channel looks like this.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User046.png


Channel n-Value Interpolator
------------------------------

1. The channel n-value interpolator
   tool is used to define the n-value of a channel cross section based on the cross section geometry.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User013.png


2. The button loads the interpolator.

3. The tool assigns an n-value for the chan.dat file based on the picture below.

4. The user can choose the n-values for a minimum or maximum cross section area.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User049.png

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User050.png

5. If the interpolator works, a message is displayed in the message bar.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/User051.png

Channel Confluence Editor
------------------------------

1. Set up confluences using the Confluence editor.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/user070.png

2. Make sure a tributary or split left bank element is adjacent to a left or right bank element of a main channel.

.. image:: ../../img/User-Cross-Sections-Widget/user071.png

3. The confluence finder will find a list of adjacent elements that can be used for the confluence.  Pick the one
   most likely to allow flow to exchange between the two channels.
