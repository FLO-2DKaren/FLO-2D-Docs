Initial Condition Editor
========================

The Initial Condition Editor is used to set the FLO-2D Initial conditions. This editor is used to set the following
initial conditions:

- Reservoirs
- Channel Initial Depth
- Tailings Stack

.. image:: ../../img/Widgets/initialconditions.png

.. important:: The available groups depend on the simulation settings. The previous image illustrates a two-phase simulation,
               where both a clear water reservoir and a tailings reservoir can be modeled simultaneously.
               However, if the simulation is set to clear water only, only the water reservoir will be displayed to the user.
               Conversely, if the simulation is set to mudflow, only the tailings group will be shown.

Initial Condition Outline
---------------------------

The Initial Condition Editor is a tool designed to generate the .DAT files required for different types of simulations.
Depending on the configuration of the switches, the editor exports specific files customized to the selected simulation type.

The flow chart below outlines the logic for exporting .DAT files based on the switches' selection:

.. mermaid::

   graph TD

        E[INFLOW.DAT] --> |Clear Water|A[MUD = 0 <br/> ISED = 0]
        E[INFLOW.DAT] --> |Mudflow|B[MUD = 1 <br/> ISED = 0]
        E[INFLOW.DAT] --> |Sediment Transport|C[MUD = 0 <br/> ISED = 1]
        E[INFLOW.DAT] --> |Two-Phase|D[MUD = 2 <br/> ISED = 0]

        I[TAILINGS.DAT] --> |Mudflow XCON = 0|B[MUD = 1 <br/> ISED = 0]

        G[TAILINGS_CV.DAT] --> |Mudflow XCON = 0|B[MUD = 1 <br/> ISED = 0]

        H[TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.DAT] -->  |Two-Phase|D[MUD = 2 <br/> ISED = 0]


Reservoirs Overview
-----------------------

The reservoir node is used to assign the water surface elevation for a reservoir or pond by specifying a single
reservoir node elevation. The FLO-2D engine model will find a reservoir node in INFLOW.DAT and assign the fill elevation to any collected grid
elements that have a lower elevation behind a levee.

The reservoir group is shown in the situations shown on the flow chart bellow:

.. mermaid::

   graph TD

        A[Reservoir Group] --> |Clear Water|B[MUD = 0 <br/> ISED = 0]
        A[Reservoir Group] --> |Sediment Transport|C[MUD = 0 <br/> ISED = 1]
        A[Reservoir Group] --> |Two-Phase|D[MUD = 2 <br/> ISED = 0]

Create a Reservoir Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reservoir data is written to the INFLOW.DAT file.

1. Click the
   Reservoir button.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia002.png


2. Click a grid element
   within the reservoir.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia006.png

3. Set the
   name and elevation.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia005.png

4. Click again on the
   Reservoir button to finish the editing.
   It is grey when on editing mode.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia003.png

5. Click Schematize
   to save the data to the schematic layers.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia004.png


6. Run a fill test with graphics mode on for 0.01 hours to see if the reservoir leaks.  Quick run works well for this.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/filltest.png


Reservoir Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common issue encountered with this tool is low reservoir bank elevation surrounding the reservoir.
If the confining reservoir bank element is lower than the reservoir elevation, the water will spill out of the cell.
Check the reservoir containment by running the FLO-2D simulation for short duration of 0.01 hours.
The reservoir will be filled and display any leaks in the maximum depth output files.


Tailings Overview
-----------------------

The tailings node is used to assign the mudflow surface elevation for a reservoir by specifying a single
tailings node elevation. The FLO-2D engine model will find the tailings reservoir node in INFLOW.DAT and
assign the fill elevation to any collected grid elements that have a lower elevation behind a levee.

The tailings polygon is used to assign the mudflow depth for a tailings reservoir by specifying a
tailings surface elevation. The difference between the assigned tailings surface elevation and the grid elevation
will be the depth considered on the TAILINGS.DAT, TAILINGS_CV.DAT, and TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.DAT.

The tailings group is shown in the situations shown on the flow chart bellow:

.. mermaid::

   graph TD

        A[Tailings Group] --> |Mudflow|C[MUD = 1 <br/> ISED = 0]
        A[Tailings Group] --> |Two-Phase|D[MUD = 2 <br/> ISED = 0]

Create a Tailings Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tailings reservoir data is written to the INFLOW.DAT file.

.. note:: It is possible to assign either reservoirs (tailings or water) or tailings polygons, but not both simultaneously.
          The FLO-2D engine can only read either the INFLOW.DAT file or the TAILINGS_*.DAT files.

1. Click the
   Tailings Reservoir button.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia013.png


2. Click a grid element
   within the reservoir.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia006.png

3. Set the
   name and elevation.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia014.png

4. Click again on the Tailings
   Reservoir button to finish the editing.
   It is grey when on editing mode.

Tailings Reservoir Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common issue encountered with this tool is the same as the clear water reservoir: low reservoir bank elevation surrounding the reservoir.
If the confining reservoir bank element is lower than the reservoir elevation, the water will spill out of the cell.
Check the reservoir containment by running the FLO-2D simulation for short duration of 0.01 hours.
The reservoir will be filled and display any leaks in the maximum depth output files.

Create a Tailings Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tailings polygon data is written to the TAILINGS.DAT, TAILINGS_CV.DAT, or TAILING_STACK_DEPTH.DAT file depending on
how the editor is set.

TAILINGS.DAT

Elevation Correction
----------------------

Before filling a reservoir, it is usually necessary to cut the ground or water elevation from the grid.  This can be
performed with raster cut tools or Civil 3D surface editor tools.

Example 1 - The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for this reservoir includes the dam and water surface.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Prepro002.png

Example 2 - The DEM for this basin includes the dam but not the water.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Elevat004.png

It is necessary to remove the dam or reservoir elevation from the grid system so it can be filled with water and
tailings using the initial condition reservoir node.

There are several tools available for performing this task.

1. The FLO-2D plugin has an elevation raster processing
   tool that can cut a dam and reservoir or tailings storage facility from a raster.
   `PreProcessing Tool <../pre-processing-tools/Pre-Processing%20Tools.html>`__.

2. The Elevation Correction Tool can remove dam elevation directly from the grid.
   `Grid Elevation Correction Tool <../grid-tools/Elevation%20Correction%20Tool.html#tin-from-points-and-polygon/>`__.

3. The QGIS Serval Plugin also has a nice cut and fill tool that is an elegantly simple way to cut and fill any raster.
   Load that plugin using the Plugin Manager.

4. Once the grid elevation is corrected, the project is ready for a reservoir node.


Channel Segment Initial Depth
-----------------------------

Use this option to set an initial depth in any channel segment.
The water depth will be assigned to every channel cross section within the segment at runtime.
The initial condition will be written to the CHANNEL.DAT file.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia007.png


1. Select
   the channel segment.

2. Set the
   initial depth.

3. Click
   Schematize to save the data to the schematic layers.

.. image:: ../../img/Initial-Condition-Editor/Initia004.png


Channel Initial Troubleshooting
----------------------------------

The simplicity of this tool makes it simple to adjust.
It is not necessary to use the tool here because the variable can also be set in the Schematized Channels Editor.
