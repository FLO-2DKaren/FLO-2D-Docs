Chapter 5: Output Files and Options
===================================

Basic guidelines for using output files.
--------------------------------------------

During the flood simulation, the user has two choices for viewing the model flood progression:

    1. An output text screen
    2. A graphical representation of the flood simulation.

The screen option is selected with the LGPLOT variable in the CONT.DAT file.
The text screen scrolls a list of the simulation time, minimum timestep and the volume conservation data.
This screen enables the user to view the simulation runtime speed and the volume conservation.
The second screen option is a color graphics display of the grid element flow depth (area of inundation) along with the inflow hydrograph.
After the flood simulation is complete, the hydraulic results are presented in output files that contain hydrographs, maximum flow depths and
velocities.

The conservation of flood volume (inflow equals outflow plus storage) should be reviewed for each simulation.
A summary of the inflow volume, final volumes left on the floodplain (storage) and outflow from the grid system is presented in the SUMMARY.OUT file.

Output files are created with both spatial and temporal formats.
Output files that are listed in the order of the output intervals are temporal output and output files listed in the order of the grid elements is
spatial output.
Output data include water surface elevation, flow depth, velocity, discharge, impact pressure, specific energy, sediment concentration and other
variables.
Overland flow hydraulics may be viewed as individual grid elements or the grid elements can be grouped together to produce floodplain cross sections.
Summary tables listing maximum velocity and flow depths and their times of occurrence appear at the end of the BASE.OUT file.
Review the CONT.DAT file description in Chapter 4 for more information about specifying output file formats.

The user is cautioned about specifying the output in too much detail which can result in extremely large output files.
The output time interval TOUT and NO- PRTFP options in the CONT.DAT file can be assigned to limit the size of the output files.
When NOPRTFP is set to 0, all the floodplain output data is written to the BASE.OUT file for each output interval.
Setting NOPRTFP = 2 will turn off all of the temporal floodplain hydraulic output data.

The user does not have to specify any output file names.
It is important to note that each time the model is run, it will write over the existing output files and the previous output file data will be lost.
To save any output files in anticipation of subsequent simulation, the user should create another subdirectory.

Use NotePad© , NotePad++© or any other ASCII editor to view the output files.
A brief description of all the output files follows:

**2 PHASE SEDIMENT VOLUME CONSERVATION.OUT**

    Summary of the final disposition of the sediment volume.

**BASE.OUT**

    BASE.OUT is an all-inclusive output file.
    At the beginning of the file, the inflow hydrographs are printed, then the time dependent output data follows.

    For each specified time output interval, the flow depth, velocity, water sur- face elevation and discharge for either the channel or the floodplain
    grid elements can be written.

    The outflow from the boundary grid elements is listed at the end of the time interval.

    After the final time output interval, a summary of all the grid elements maximum depths, water surface elevations, velocities and the time of
    occurrence of the maximum values is printed.

    Finally, a summary table of the inflow, outflow and storage volumes at the end of the file allows the user to review the conservation of mass and the
    ultimate disposition of all the water and sediment.

    For convenience, this conservation table is also written to a separate output file named SUMMARY.OUT that is more complete.

    There is so much output data in the BASE.OUT file that the user is encouraged to avoid generating this file.
    All of the text output in this file is provided in individual ASCII xyz output files for plotting purposes and the user will probably have little
    interest in the BASE.OUT format of the floodplain hydraulics for the individual grid elements.

    This output file can become large and it takes too long to write to it for models with 500,000 grid elements or more.
    Set NOPRTFP = 2 and it will not be created:

        - If NOPRTFP = 0, all the BASE.OUT floodplain flow data is reported.
        - If NOPRTFP = 1, the BASE.OUT floodplain outflow data is not reported.
        - If NOPRTFP = 2, the entire file is not created.
        - If NOPRTFP = 3, only floodplain outflow data is repIf NOPRTFP = 3, only floodplain outflow data is reported to the BASE.OUT file.

**BASEFLOWFP_TIME.OUT**

    This file provides an option to report the time when the discharge exceeds the floodplain base flow has been implemented.
    The BASEFLOWFP\_ TIME.OUT file reports the following data.

        - Grid
        - Xcoord
        - Ycoord
        - Time to above baseflow (hrs)

    With this output file from a second simulation, the arrival time of an over- land floodwave overtaking a base flow is reported.
    A similar option was coded for channel base flow (uses a B-line with the baseflow in CHAN.
    DAT on a channel segment basis).
    The IFLOODWAVE switch is not necessary for reporting the time when the discharge exceeds the channel baseflow.
    The reporting is activated by the CHAN.DAT B-line.

    The floodplain time above baseflow reporting option requires 2 two simulations: 1) Set IFLOODWAVE = 0 in CONT.DAT and prepare INFLOW.
    DAT with only the base flow hydrographs and run the model.
    2) Set IF- LOODWAVE = 2 and swap out the INFLOW.DAT file with the flood hydrograph (such as a dam breach hydrograph) and run the model a second time
    to generate the BASEFLOWFP_TIME.OUT file.

**BATCH COMPARISON FILES**

    Running the batch processor will execute many projects in series and perform automatic comparisons of the output data from previous runs.
    The following files represent the comparison dataset:

        - DEPFP_ANTERIOR.OUT
        - DIFF_DEPFP.OUT
        - FINALDEP_ANTERIOR.OUT
        - DIFF_FINALDEP.OUT

**BINARY FILES**


    The following binary backup files are generated when IBACKUP = 1.
    These files can be used to restart model after termination (either interrupted simulation or end of the simulation).

        - CHANBINARY.OUT
        - CROSSBINARY.OUT
        - FPLAINBINARY.OUT
        - HYSTRUCBINARY.OUT
        - SEDBINARY.OUT
        - STREETBINARY.OUT
        - VOLUMEBINARY.OUT
        - XSECSEDBINARY.OUT

**BREACH.OUT**

    This file is generated when the erosion breach routine is activated for dams or levees.
    The output is listed by grid element number with singular and tabular results.
    The initial and peak discharge is reported for each grid element and the time each occurred.
    The failure node, direction, start time, start discharge, peak discharge, and peak time are reported on lines 2 and 3.
    This is followed by the tabular data.

    The tabular data is reported for the breach discharge as follows:

        - Time (hrs) - simulation time output
        - Direction - breach direction 1-8 grid element directions
        - Breach Q - total discharge through the breach and the end of the interval (cfs or cms)
        - Sediment discharge - total sediment through the breach at the end of the interval (cfs or cms)
        - Sediment concentration - concentration of sediment in the breach
        - Bottom width - breach width at the bottom of the dam or levee at the output interval (ft or m)
        - Top width - breach width at the top of the dam or levee at the output interval (ft or m)
        - Breach elevalevee at the output interval (ft or m)
        - Breach elevation - elevation of the bottom of the breach at the output interval (ft or m)

The units are pounds force per foot (newton per linear meter).
This is the impact force on a wall or feature of a unit length.
Multiple by the length of the cell or the length of the dump to get the total maximum impact force on the feature.
Please note that this would be an impact force if the maximum velocity were instantaneous on the wall or feature as in a frontal wave.
If the flow gradually increases on the wall and the maximum velocity occurs with the flow going over the wall or feature then the impact force will be
mitigated.
The conservative approach to the impact force would consider that the maximum velocity occurs in a frontal wave that would instantaneously stop.
As the impact force is a one-time instantaneous maximum value based on flow cessation is not temporally reported by output interval.

MULTCHN.OUT

The multiple channel routine routes the overland flow between grid elements as concentrated channel flow (i.e.
rill and gully flow).
For grid elements specified for multiple channel flow, overland flow only occurs within the grid element and the flow between the elements is conveyed
as gully flow.
Once the flow enters the multiple channels, the channel will enlarge to contain the flow.
This occurs when the flow depth exceeds the specified channel depth.
The channel increases by a specified incremental width.
After the peak discharge has passed and the flow depth is less than one foot, the channel width will decrease until it reaches the original width.
MULTCHN.OUT identifies multiple channel revisions including the maximum width, final width and the original width for each grid element.

These revisions are usually the result of the rating table being created with low n-values or because the rating table has insufficient low depth
stage-discharge pairs or the cross section do not match the rating table data.

ROUGH.OUT

The ROUGH.OUT file reports the automated Manning’s n-value adjustment during model simulation including n-value change for exceeding the Courant
number and exceeding the limiting Froude.
The user specifies a maximum Froude number for overland, channel and street ?ow.
When the computed Froude number exceeds the defined maximum value for a given grid element, the n-value for that grid element is increased by a value
based on the percent change in the n-value.
During the falling limb of the hydrograph when the Froude number is no longer exceeded, the n-value is decreased by 0.0005 until the original n-value
is reached.
When the Courant number timestep is exceeded consecutive times by the same grid element, then n-value is also increased.
With increasing consecutive timestep decrements, the increase in n-value decreases.
The maximum n-value, time of occurrence, and original n-values for floodplain, channel and street are listed in ROUGH.OUT by grid element.

When the channel cross section option is invoked for channel routing, the channel geometry data is written to this file.
It includes: grid element, flow area, top width and wetted perimeter for the lowest top of bank (bankfull flow).

    - Grid element
    - Flow area of the cross section (sqft or sqm)
    - Top width of the cross section (ft or m)
    - Wetted Perimeter of the cross section (ft or m)

XSEC.OUT

This file is created by the channel sediment transport option (ISED = 1 in CONT.
DAT and ISEDN = 1 for a channel segment in CHAN.DAT) for natural cross section geometry data.
It contains the final cross section bed elevations after scour and deposition have been computed.
The file looks the same as XSEC.DAT with updated elevation data.
