CHAPTER 7: Debugging and Trouble Shooting the Data Files
========================================================

**Troubleshooting Guidelines**

**Data Errors**

Data input errors may result in the automatic termination of a simulation run along with a Fortran error message.
The error message will report a ‘Unit’ number that is associated with the FLO-2D file that contains the error.
The files are listed in Table 4.1, Table 7.1, and Table 7.2.

**Troubleshooting: Is the flood simulation running OK?**

There are several indicators to help you identify modeling problems.
The most important one is volume conservation.
The FLO-2D results should be reviewed for volume conservation, surging, timestep decrements, and roughness adjustments with limiting Froude numbers.

*Volume Conservation*

   Any hydraulics model that does not report on volume conservation should be suspected of generating or losing volume.
   A review of the SUMMARY.
   OUT file will identify any volume conservation problems.
   This file will dis- play the time when the volume conservation error began to appear during the simulation.
   Typically a volume conservation error greater 0.001 percent is an indication that the model could be improved.
   The file CHVOLUME.
   OUT will indicate if the volume conservation error occurred in the channel routing instead of the overland flow component.
   Components should be switched ‘off’ one at a time and the model simulation run again until the volume conservation problem disappears.
   This will identify which com- ponent is causing the difficulty.
   Some volume conservation problems may be eliminated by slowing the model down (decreasing the timesteps) using the numerical stability criteria.
   Most volume conservation problems are an indication of data errors.

*Surging*

   It is possible for volume to be conserved during a flood simulation and still have numerical surging.
   Numerical surging is the result of a mismatch be- tween flow area, slope and roughness.
   It can cause an over-steepening of the floodwave identified by spikes in the output hydrographs.
   Channel surging can be identified by discharge spikes in the CHANMAX.OUT file or in the HYDROG program plotted hydrographs.
   Predicted high maximum velocities indicate surging.
   To identify floodplain surging, review the maximum velocities in the MAXPLOT or Mapper post-processor program.
   You can also review the VELTIMEC.OUT (channel) or VELTIMEFP.OUT (flood- plain) files for unreasonable maximum velocities.
   Surging can be reduced or eliminated by adjusting (lowering) the stability criteria (COURANT or DEPTOLFP in TOLER.DAT) thus decreasing the timesteps.
   If decreasing the timesteps fails to eliminate the surging, then individual grid element topography, slope or roughness should be adjusted.
   This can be accomplished in the FLO-2D Plugin for floodplain flow.
   For channel flow, the PROFILES program can be used to make adjustments.
   Increasing the flow roughness will generally reduce or eliminate flow surging.
   For channel surging, abrupt transitions in flow areas between contiguous channel elements should be avoided.
   Setting a lower limiting Froude number for a channel reach may also help to identify the problem.

*Sticky Grid Elements*

   When the flood simulation is running slowly, the TIME.OUT file can be reviewed to determine which grid elements are causing the most timestep
   decreases (‘sticky elements’).
   TIME.OUT lists the top twenty floodplain, channel or street elements that caused the model to slow down.
   The file also lists whether the timestep decreases occur with the percent change in depth, Courant criteria or dynamic wave stability criteria.
   Adjustments can be made in the stability criteria to more equably distribute the timestep decreases.
   The model is designed to advance and decrement timesteps, so there have to be grid elements listed in the TIME.OUT file.
   If one or two grid elements have significantly more timestep decreases than the other elements listed in the file, the attributes of the ‘sticky’ grid
   elements such as topography, slope or roughness should be adjusted.
   The goal is to make the model run as fast as possible while avoiding numerical surging.

   If a floodplain element is causing most of the timestep decreases, check the SURFAREA.OUT file to determine how much surface area is left in the
   floodplain element for flood storage.
   If the floodplain element contains a channel bank, there may be very little surface area left for flood storage.
   This will cause the model run slowly with exchanges the flow between the channel and floodplain.
   To fix this problem:

- Remove other components from the channel bank element including streets or ARF values.

- Shorten the channel length (XLEN in CHAN.DAT).
  This will in- crease the surface area in the channel bank floodplain elements.

- Decrease the channel cross section width in the PROFILES program.

-

*Limiting Froude Numbers*

   There is a unique relationship between floodwave celerity and average flow velocity described by the Froude number that should not be violated during
   numerical flood routing.
   This is a physical relationship between the kinematic and gravitation forces.
   To use the limiting Froude number, estimate a reasonaclsble maximum Froude number for your flood simulation and assign the value to either FROUDL
   (floodplain), FROUDC (channels) or STRF- NO (streets) variables.
   When the computed Froude number exceeds the limiting Froude number, the n-value is increased by a small value (~ 0.001) for the next timestep.
   This change in grid element n-value helps to create a better match between the slope, flow area and n-value during the simulation.
   When the limiting Froude number is no longer exceeded, the n-value is gradually decreased to the original value.
   The changes in the n-values during the simulation are reported in the ROUGH.OUT file.
   For the next FLO-2D simulation, grid element n-value adjustments can be made using the n-values reported in ROUGH.OUT.
   The maximum n-values are also reported in MANNINGS_M.RGH, CHAN.RGH and STREET.RGH files that are created at the end of a simulation.
   These (\*.RGH) files can then be renamed to data input files (\*.DAT) for the next flood simulation (e.g. MANNINGS_N.RGH = MANNINGS_N.DAT).

*Reviewing the results*

   FLO-2D results include the maximum area of inundation as displayed by the maximum flow depth, temporal and spatial hydraulic results, channel or
   floodplain cross section hydrographs and peak discharges.
   The Mapper++ program can used to review maximum flow depths, water surface elevations or velocities.
   The results can be plotted as either line contours or shaded contours in Mapper++.
   Look for any maximum velocities or flow depths that are unreasonable.
   This may be an indication of numerical surging.

   The FLO-2D flood simulation can be terminated at any time during the run by clicking Exit on the toolbar.
   The simulation will terminate after the current output interval is completed and the output files are generated and saved.
   This enables the user to check if the flood simulation is running poorly (e.g. too slow or not conserving volume) and the simulation can be stopped
   without losing the opportunity to review the output data.

**Make some adjustments**

The following data file adjustments may improve the simulation and speed up the model:

*Spatial Variation of n-values*

   The most common cause of numerical surging is underestimated n-values.
   Typical n-values represent steady, uniform flow.
   Spatial variation of n-values will affect the floodwave progression (travel time) and reduce surging, but may not significantly impact the area of
   inundation (especially for longer flood durations).
   Focus on the critical part of the project area when adjusting n-values and review TIME.OUT and ROUGH.OUT to complete the n-value revisions.

*Edit Topography*

   The interpolation of DTM points to assign elevations to grid elements is not perfect even when the FLO-2D Plugin filters are applied.
   It may be necessary to adjust some floodplain grid element elevations when you review the results.
   MAXPLOT and Mapper++ can be used to locate grid elements with unreasonable flow depths that may constitute inappropriate depressions.
   Floodplain depressions can sometimes occur along a river channel if too many floodplain DTM points located within the channel.

*Floodplain Surface Area Reduction*

   The distribution of flood storage on the grid system can be influenced by as- signing area reduction factors (ARF’s) to represent loss of storage (i.e.
   buildings).
   For large flood events, the assignment of individual grid element ARF values will usually have minor impact on the area of inundation.
   For local flooding detail, individual grid element ARF assignments may be justified.

*Channel Cross Section Adjustments*

   Typically a surveyed cross section will represent five to ten channel elements.
   Selecting a cross section to represent transitions between wide and narrow cross sections requires engineering judgment.
   Use the PROFILES program to interpolate the transition between surveyed cross sections.

*Channel Slope Adjustments*

   Adverse channel slopes can be simulated by FLO-2D.
   Smoothing out an irregular slope condition over several channel elements to represent reach average slope conditions may speed up the simulation.
   Cross sections with scour holes can result in local adverse slopes that misrepresent the average reach conditions.
   Review the channel slope in PROFILES.

*Street Flow*

   High street velocities may cause numerical surging and slow the simulation down.
   Assign reasonable limiting street Froude numbers to adjust the street n-values.

**Model Calibration and Replication of Flood Events**

Estimating flood hydrology (both rainfall and flood hydrographs) can be difficult when replicating historical floods.
To match measured flood stages, high water marks or channel discharges, first determine a reasonable estimate of the flood volume, then concentrate on
the model details such as n-values, ARF’s and street flow.
Flood volume is more important to flood routing than the peak discharge.

**Trouble Shooting Technique**

When undertaking a new FLO-2D flood simulation, start simple and progressively build in model component detail.
After the required data files have been prepared, run a basic overland flood simulation.
Review the results.
If any issues arise consult the troubleshooting tips found in this chapter.
Table 7.2 lists some common data errors.

To debug the data files after a FLO-2D simulation, begin by reviewing the ER- ROR.CHK file.
All the data errors recognized by the model are reported in this file.
FLO-2D has an extensive data error and warning message system and the messages are reported in ERROR.CHK as data inconsistencies are encountered.
One of the most common errors is missing data that will invoke an end-of-file error statement to the screen.
This error occurs when the model is searching for more data than is in the data file.
Another common error is to activate a component or process switch without preparing the required data file.
For example, an error will occur if the component switch ICHANNEL = 1 in the CONT.DAT file, but the data file CHAN.DAT is not available.

One data error that is difficult to locate is the array allocation violation where the array index number becomes zero or larger than the assigned
value.
For example, there may be missing sediment concentrations in INFLOW.DAT for a mudflow simulation.
This made a code error where a variable is not initialized to zero.
When this type of error is encountered, the FLO-2D model is terminated with a FOR- TRAN error message without indicating the file location or line
entry of the error.
To locate the data error, simplify the simulation and turn off all of the components and turn them back on one at time until the error occurs again.
Reset simulation time to the model time just after the error occurred to reduce time to debug the model.
If attempts to debug an error are ineffective, send a zipped copy of the data files to FLO-2D (contact@flo-2d.com) along with brief description of the
problem.

The user can create a set of backup data files to debug the model.
Set IBACKUP = 1 in the CONT.DAT file.
These backup files replicate the data files and will indicate if the computer is reading the data files correctly.
The backup file should be identical to the original data file except for spacing.
If the program terminates before reaching the first output interval timestep, there is probably an error in the data files.
Start by checking the \*.BAC files one by one.
If one of the files is not complete, this may be the location of the data error.

Review the following files to analyze volume conservation problems: SUMMARY.
OUT, CHVOLUME.OUT, CHANMAX.OUT, TIME.OUT, BASE.OUT, ROUGH.OUT, CHANNEL.CHK, and SURFAREA.OUT.
See the ‘Pocket

Guide’ for further troubleshooting tips involving volume conservation, sticky grid elements listed in the TIME.OUT file, and numerical surging.
The instructional comments at the end of each data file description in this manual contains a number of guidelines to assist the user in creating or
checking the data files.

**List of Common Data Errors**

A list of the most common errors associated with running FLO-2D is presented below and a table for troubleshooting runtime errors follows the list.
Whenever an error is encountered, refer to the ERROR.CHK file first.
All of the \*.CHK files are listed in Table 7.3.
The file descriptions can be referenced in Chapter 5.

   * - 12. The ISEDN switch for channel sediment transport was not‘turned on’ in the CHAN.DAT file for the channel segment.


**Runtime Errors**

If the simulation stops before reaching the prescribed simulation time, review the output files for diagnostic information:

- If the program ends with a Fortran Error, screenshot the error message.
  It may reveal the file location where the error occurred.

- Review the \*.CHK files for potential data errors.

- Review the channel check files for potential errors.

Volume Conservation Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most volume conservation and numerical stability problems are associated with channel flow.
When constructing a channel system, it is often necessary to fabricate cross section geometry, estimate roughness or adjust channel bed slopes.
Mismatched channel morphology parameters with an appropriate roughness are the primary source of numerical stability problems.
To compute smoother hydraulics between two channel grid elements, adjust the bed slope, cross section flow area or roughness values.
Try to avoid abrupt changes in cross sections geometry from one channel element to another.
The channel flow area for a natural channel (not a concrete rectangular or trapezoidal channel geometry) should make a gradual transition from a wide,
shallow cross section to a narrow deep cross section.
An actual cross section transition may occur over several channel grid elements.
Adjust the channel geometry so that the maximum change in flow area between channel elements is less than 25%.
To address channel problems, consider the following measures:

- Increase the roughness in wide, shallow cross sections and decrease the roughness in narrow deep channel grid elements.

- Reduce the difference between the cross-section areas.
  Avoid abrupt cross section transitions between channel elements.
  Adjust the channel cross section geometry in the PROFILES.
  Use PROFILES to re-interpolate between surveyed cross sections.

- Review and adjust the bed slope with the PROFILES program.
  Adverse bed slopes are OK but adverse spikes and dips are not.

- Select a longer channel length within the channel grid element.

One Drive Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running simulations on projects that are stored on a directory that is synced to One Drive may result in a simulation crash.
Small projects that run quickly and do not have long intervals between data output might be OK but it is a poor modeling practice to run projects on
paths like the Desktop or Documents folder that will always sync to Microsoft One Drive.
Not only does this practice risk a simulation crash, it also results in overall sluggish computational behavior.
Forcing a memory analysis and sync places a unnecessary burden on computer processors.
If simulations take more than 12 hours, consider moving projects to a directory that is not syncing to One Drive.

Anti-Virus Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program are important but allowing them to continually scan for viruses or malware will add a processing burden to the computer.
If a simulation takes more than 12 hours, consider running it on a computer that is dedicated to modeling that can be isolated with a firewall that
limits web traffic so that anti-virus software scans can be limited or turned off while the simulation is running.

External Drives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running simulations on external drives may result in a crash due to drive connectivity errors.
It will also slow simulations since the data transfer at runtime is happening over the network path that connects the computer to the drive.
External drives may also have protections so that executables cannot write data to the drive.
It is better to run simulations on the local computer.

Servers and Virtual Computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running simulations on servers or virtual computers is relatively straight for- ward and easy.
For a Virtual Computer, simply set up the computer the same way a normal installation is performed.
FLO-2D and QGIS can be installed on a Virtual Computer.
Use it just like a regular computer.

Servers can be set up for running FLO-2D models but it is not necessary to install FLO-2D in order to run simulations.
A program like Docker can be used to build, deploy, and optimize server configurations.
Get help from an IT professional and FLO-2D staff to explore this option.
It should be noted that for FLO-2D no server system can outperform a high performance desktop computer running AMD high performance processors.

**Debugging Errors**

In addition to the following troubleshooting guide, refer to the ‘Getting Started Guidelines’ at the begin of this manual and the Pocket Guide to
assist in debugging runtime errors.

Program will not run:

- Data errors.
  Turn off the component switches until the model runs.

- The executable program was damaged.
  Reload the program or contact technical support.

- The model is not properly licensed.
  Contact technical support.

Program stops

   The model run is terminated before the first timestep or after a few timesteps with data file error indicated on the screen or in ERROR.CHK:

- Review the ERROR.CHK file or the data file identified by the program error message.

- Review the backup file (\*.
  BAC).

- Review the List of Common Data Errors.

Program stops

   The model run is terminated after several timesteps indicating a numerical stability error.
   The grid element causing the stability error is listed on the screen instability dialog box or at the end of the BASE.OUT file.

Stability criteria were not met.

   Review and revise the elevation and roughness data for the indicated grid element.
   The ROUGH.OUT and TIME.OUT files will help to locate the problem grid element.
   Check the contiguous grid elements to the problem element in the 8 directions as the problem may be with the neighbor element.

Volume conservation

   The volume conservation may indicate either a loss or gain of volume.
   A review of the SUMMARY.OUT and CHVOLUME.OUT will reveal if the volume conservation error is in the channel or on the floodplain.
   Volume conservation problems are indication of data error.

Discharge surging

   Numerical surging, which involves alternating low and high discharges, is typically associated with channel flow.
   Floodplain surging can also occur but is less common.
   Maximum floodplain velocities should be reviewed in the MAXPLOT, VELTIMEC.OUT, and VELTIMEFP.OUT files.
   Any unreasonable maximum velocities identified should be addressed.

   Other files that may indicate numerical surging include CHANMAX.
   OUT, HYCHAN.OUT, CHANSTABILITY.OUT, TIME.OUT, and ROUGH.OUT.

   Hydrograph plots generated in the HYDROG program may show spikes that suggest surging.
   It is important to note that surging can occur even when overall volume conservation remains acceptable.

Supercritical flow

   Supercritical flow is not necessary a problem, but its occurrence should be limited to conditions where it is expected such as in streets, concrete
   channels or steep bedrock watersheds.
   Supercritical flow on alluvial surfaces should be avoided.

Numerical Instability:

   The channel surging may be related to numerical instability, abrupt changes in channel geometry, inappropriate slopes, supercritical flow or variable
   mudflow sediment concentrations.
   Mismatched slope, flow area and n-values are the most common causes of channel instability.
   A combination of revisions may improve numerical instability.

- Abrupt changes in slope or severe adverse slope may cause in- stability.
  Use the PROFILES program to fix irregular bed slope conditions.

- Review the cross-section flow areas over several channel elements in PROFILES.
  Eliminate any abrupt changes in cross section areas between channel elements.
  If the surging occurs at low flows, review only the bottom portion of the cross section not the bankfull conditions.

- Decrease the channel Courant number in the TOLER.DAT file.
  Decrease the Courant number in 0.1 increments until a reason- able lower limit of 0.2 is reached.

- Insufficient floodplain area.
  Small floodplain surface areas can exacerbate unsteady flow.
  Review SURFAREA.OUT and in- crease the available grid element surface area for flood storage.

- Increase the n-values for the grid elements in the vicinity of the surging flow.

- Adjust the floodplain grid element elevations around the problem element.

- Increase the channel length within the grid element.

- The hydraulic structure discharge rating curve or table may be poorly matched with the upstream or downstream channel hydraulics.
  Review the hydraulic structure rating curve or table and compare the discharge values to those found in the HYCHAN.OUT file for that particular
  channel element or the next one upstream.

Unexpected supercritical flow on alluvial surfaces:

- Adjust the limiting Froude number using the FROUDL variable in the CONT.DAT file or the FROUDC variable in the CHAN.
  DAT.

- Increase the floodplain or channel roughness values.

- Modify the slope.
  The grid elevations assigned by the FLO-2D Plugin may not be representative of the field condition.
  Change the grid element elevations to make the channel or floodplain slope more uniform.

Variable mudflow sediment concentration:

- Review the sediment concentration in the inflow hydrographs in the INFLOW.DAT file.

- The relationships for viscosity and yield stress should fall with the research data presented in the reference manual.

FLO-2D simulation runs slow

   Review the TIME.OUT file to identify the elements that have caused most of the timestep reductions.
   Small timesteps are the result of the model continually exceeding the numerical stability criteria for a small group of grid elements.
   The change in flow depth for a timestep may be too large.
   One of primary reasons for a slow flood simulation is that the relationship between the discharge flux and grid element surface area is poor.
   The rate of change in the discharge may be too high for the selected grid element size.
   Increasing the grid element size is the best way to fix a very slow model.

   Other solutions may include:

- Adjust the channel geometry in transition reaches.

- Create a more uniform channel or floodplain slope.

- Revise the roughness values or limit the supercritical flow.

- Reduce the channel width, street width, ARF values or other parameters to increase the floodplain surface area.
  Review the SURFAREA.OUT file.

- Check for updates.
  FLOPRO.EXE updates.

- Increase the grid element size (a last resort).

The inflow hydrograph does not plot in the graphics display

- No hydrograph is associated with the IDEPLT variable.

- The hydrograph duration is too long.
  Reduce the hydrograph length.

- The rainfall duration is too long.
  Reduce the rainfall time.

- Inappropriate peak discharge or total rainfall values distort the scale for hydrograph plot.

Program stops.
Excessive flow depths

If flow depths are excessive, then ponding or surging may be occurring.

- Identify the problem element in MAXPLOT or in the end of the BASE.OUT file.

- Check TIME.OUT to determine if the problem element is also causing the model to run slowly.

- Check the elevation of the problem grid element in the TOPO.
  DAT or in the FLO-2D Plugin.

- If the depressed element is a gravel pit or some other feature, increase the n-value to decrease the velocity (vertical overfall velocity) into the
  pit.

Erratic discharge in the channel elements.

   A review of plotted hydrographs in HYDROG or an examination of the CHANMAX.OUT or HYCHAN.OUT files will reveal if the flow discharge between
   contiguous channel elements is surging with spikes when a consistent rise or fall of the downstream discharge is expected.

   Channel surging can be natural phenomena.
   Rivers can rise and fall over a few tenths of a foot in matter of seconds in reaches that are expanding and contracting causing rapidly variable
   storage.
   During high flow in a large river, the variation in discharge associated with stage change on the order of

   ~0.2 ft can be 1,000 cfs or more.
   Review the numerical surging trouble- shooting.
   If the channel surging is severe, the two conditions to review are:

- Review the channel confluence and make the confluence pairs are properly assigned.
  See the CONFLUENCE.OUT file.

- The channel grid elements in the CHAN.DAT file may be mis- identified.

Erratic flow in the floodplain grid elements.

   Erratic flow in the floodplain grid elements is usually the result of errors in the TOPO.DAT file.
   This type of error generally occurs when the user edits the TOPO.DAT file manually and adds, subtracts or moves grid elements around.
   Virtually all erratic flow conditions on the floodplain can be corrected by revisions either to n-values or elevations in the FLO-2D Plugin.

Channel extends through another channel element.

   The right channel bank assignments are automated in the FLO-2D Plugin.
   Multiple left bank elements can be assigned to the same right bank on a river bend.
   If a channel extends through a right bank element, the model will generate an error message reported in ERROR.CHK file.

   The channel bank elements can be viewed in the FLO-2D Plugin.
   If there is a problem with the channel bank alignment, simply revised the right bank element.
   The right bank element can be any grid element if it does not cross another connecting channel bank line.

Program stops; identifying one or more grid elements with too little flood- plain surface.

   The model will generate a message in ERROR.CHK if the channel right bank has is too little surface storage area on the floodplain portion of the
   element.
   If this problem occurs and the floodplain surface is less than 5%, then there are several solutions:

- Reduce the ARF value, multiple channel area or street area.

- The channel area can be reduced by decreasing the XLEN variable or top width, which is a function of the channel in the natural channels, the side
  slopes, or the bottom width in the trapezoidal cross section or the width in the rectangular cross section.

- As a last resort the grid element size can be increased, but this requires the re-generation of the grid system.

CADPTS.DAT error

   If errors are reported in this file, delete CADPTS.DAT, FPLAIN.DAT, and NEIGHBORS.DAT run the model again.
   The FLOPRO.EXE will rewrite this file.

**Debug Output Tables**

The DEBUG.OUT file is created when the user runs the model in Debug model via the QGIS Plugin.
The error codes in Tables 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 are the codes used in the Debug system.
They help identify data errors and data conflicts.
