Chapter 4: Input Data File Description
======================================

General
-----------

The FLO-2D data file variables and format are described in this chapter.
These files are accessed directly by the model.
For each data file a list of the variables, a portion of an example data file, and an alphabetical description of
the variables are presented.
Some instructional comments follow the variable descriptions for clarification.
QGIS or any ASCII text editor can be used to create or edit the data files.

All of the data entries, integers (i) or real numbers (r) are in free format space delimited.
The ID characters (letters) are case sensitive.
The variables are listed line by line and each line may contain several variables that are highlighted by
bold text and capital letters.
Array variables are indexed as shown in the following example from the INFLOW.DAT file, Line 3:

   Line 3 **HYDCHAR = ‘H’, HP(I,J,1), HP(I,J,2), HP(I,J,3)**

   *I = 1, J = 1, Number of inflow hydrograph pairs*

   where:

       I and J (array indices) represent element number and hydrograph pair.

       **H(I,J,1)** = time (hrs) start of the discretized interval of inflow hydrograph.

       **H(I,J,2)** = discharge (cfs).

       **H(I,J,3)** = mudflow sediment concentration by volume inflow hydrograph.

       **HDYCHAR** is a line identifier character ‘H’.

The variables in Line 3 on the INFLOW.DAT file represent one line of a discretized inflow hydrograph that is
repeated for each of the hydrograph pairs for each inflow grid element.
The Line 3 data for the first four-time steps is as follows:

    </pre>
    </div>

Backup files of the data files (\*.BAC) can be created when program reads the data.
The backup option is invoked by a switch (IBACKUP) in the CONT.DAT file.

List of Program file units
------------------------------

The following table lists the data and output file (‘Unit’) numbers that are assigned by the FLO-2D model at runtime.
These unit numbers may be reported in error messages and referring to these numbers may help to locate input data
errors.

Data files
--------------

Four data files are required for every flood simulation: CONT.DAT, TOLER.DAT, FPLAIN.DAT, CADPTS.DAT.
The INFLOW.DAT and OUTFLOW.DAT files are optional, but typically are necessary for a FLO-2D flood simulation.
The CADPTS.DAT is not listed. Although, it is required for every flood simulation, this file is automatically
created by the FLO-2D Plugin and QGIS and does not require editing.
The TOPO.DAT and MANNINGS_N.DAT files are generated by the Plugin QGIS and the FLO-2D Pro model at runtime.
The TOPO.DAT and MANNINGS_N.DAT files replace the FPLAIN.DAT and CADPTS.DAT file (are obsolete and not necessary
but can still be used).

**Variable Descriptions for the CONT.DAT File**

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 0


   * - VARIABLE
     - FMT
     - RANGE
     - DESCRIPTION

   * - AMANN
     - **r**
     - **0**

       **-1 to 1**

       **-99 > 1.0**
     - Increments the floodplain Manning’s n roughness coefficient at runtime.

       If AMANN is 0, n = n.

       If the ABS(AMANN) < 1, n = n + AMANN (positive or negative).

       If the AMANN > 1, n = n \* AMANN (positive).

       If the AMANN < -1, n = n \* (1 + AMANN) where AMANN is negative.

       After AMANN is applied, the shallow n is applied.

       If AMANN is -99 no depth integrate n-value adjustment and no adjustment for

       exceeding Courant number.

   * - DEPRESS-DEPTH
     - **r**
     - **-110.0 to**

       **10.0**
     - The DEPRESSDEPTH variable has two functions:

       DEPRESSDEPTH identifies depressed grid elements that are lower than all contiguous nodes.

       A value of DEPRESSDEPTH = 3.0 ft is suggested.

       Depressed elements may be real, but in most cases isolated depressed elements are a result

       of poor topographic data.

       Identifies low levee crest elevations.

       A typical value of DEPRESSDEPTH 3.0 (default value = zero).

       (see comments 11 and 12).

   * - DEPTHDUR
     - **r**
     - **0.01 - 100**

       **0.003 - 30**
     - Flow depth (ft or m) for a depth-duration analysis. When a flow depth greater than DEPTHDUR is computed,

       the time duration of inundation for that grid element is tracked and reported in the DEPTHDUR.OUT file

       (see comment 8).

   * - ENCROACH
     - **r**
     - **0 - 10**

       **0 - 3**
     - The floodway encroachment increase in flow depth (ft or m). The IFLOODWAY switch must be set to 1 and

       a previous FLO-2D simulation must be completed for the project to generate the maximum water surface

       elevations.

   * - ENDTIMTEP
     - r
     -
     - The end time for the delayed time series output data (hours). Should be greater than STARTTIMTEP and

       up to SIMUL.

       To shorten the timeseries output, set the value to a lower time limit than SIMUL.

   * - FROUDL
     - r
     - **0 - 5**
     - Limiting Froude number for overland flow. When FROUDL is exceeded, the floodplain n-value is

       increased by 0.001 for that grid element for the next timestep (see comment 3).

       The increased n-values are reported in the ROUGH.OUT and FPLAIN.RGH files (see comments 3 and 4).

   * - GRAPTIM
     - r
     - **0.01 - 10.**
     - Time interval in hours that the graphics display is updated (e.g. set GRAPTIM = 0.02 for a

       frequent update).

       GRAPHTIM is required when LGPLOT = 2.

       This variable will not affect the file output data time interval (TOUT).

       The graphics mode is limited to a 48-day inflow hydrograph.

   * - IBACKUP
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**

       **2**
     - IBACKUP = 1 creates a backup file of all the data files with a \*.BAC extension for data

       error troubleshooting.

       It also enables the model to be resumed following termination from the last output interval.

       IBACKUP = 2 enables elevation changes for outflow nodes made at runtime to be permanently

       written to the FPLAIN.RGH file (see comment 10).

   * - ICHANNEL
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - If ICHANNEL = 1, the channel component will be used and the CHAN.DAT must be created.

       (comments 1 and 6).

   * - IDEBRV
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set IDEBRV = 1 if a debris basin volume should be filled before routing the flow hydrograph.

   * - IEVAP
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set IEVAP = 1 if simulating free water surface evaporation from overland or channel flow.

   * - IFLOODWAY
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**

       **2 = on**
     - If IFLOODWAY = 1, a floodway analysis will be performed in the subsequent FLO-2D simulation.

       An initial FLO-2D flood simulation must be completed prior to a floodway simulation (see comment 5).

       If IFLOODWAY = 2, the floodway base flow condition is defined by the DEPFP.OUT from a previous run

       that lists the maximum flow depth associated with an inflow hydrograph that represents only the

       base flow.

       Run the baseflow run first and then set the IFLOODWAY = 2 and run the flood simulation in the same

       folder so that a flood arrival time and a peak flood time are reported separately.

       Results in TIME_TO_ABOVE_BASFLOW.OUT

   * - IHYDRSTRUCT
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set IHYDRSTRUCT = 1 to simulate hydraulic structures either on the floodplain or in the channel.

       The HYSTRUC.DAT file must be created.

   * - IMULTC
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set IMULTC = 1 to simulate multiple channel (rill and gully flow) rather than overland sheet flow

       between multiple channel elements.

       The MULT.DAT file must be created.

   * - IMODFLOW
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set IMODFLOW = 1 to simulate surface-groundwater exchange. This switch initiated the linked MODFLOW

       groundwater model a during the FLO-2D simulation.

   * - INFIL
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - INFIL = 1 initiates an infiltration subroutine using the Green-Ampt infiltration model for either

       channel or over- land infiltration.
       The INFIL.DAT file must be created.

   * - IRAIN
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set IRAIN = 1 to simulate rain on the grid system.
       The RAIN.DAT file must be created (see comment 1).

   * - ISED
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - If ISED = 1, the sediment transport routine will be used.
       The SED.DAT file must be created.

   * - ITIMTEP
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1, 2, 3, 4, 5,**

       **and 6 = on**

       **11, 21, 31,**

       **41, 51 =**

       **on for an interval**
     - 0 = No time series output is written.

       1 = TIMDEP.OUT and TIMDEP_NC4.out are written.

       2 = TIMDEP.HDF5 files is written.

       3 = TIMDEPNC.HDF5 file is written.

       4 = All time series output is written.

       5 = Extract a time series for specific cells.
       Requires TIM- DEPCELL.DAT

       11 = TIMDEP.OUT and TIMDEP_NC4.OUT are written for the time interval.

       21 = TIMDEP.HDF5 files is written for the time interval.

       31 = TIMDEPNC.HDF5 file is written for the time interval.

       41 = All time series output is written for the time interval.

       51 = Extract a time series during the time interval for specific cells. Requires TIMDEPCELL.DAT

   * - IWRFS
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - IWRFS = 1 specifies that area and width reduction factors (ARFs and WRFs) will be assigned in

       the ARF.DAT file.

   * - LEVEE

     - Set LEVEE = 1 to simulate levees.
       The LEVEE.DAT file must be created.

   * - LGPLOT
     - s
     - **0 = text**

       **1 = batch**

       **2 = graphic**
     - LGPLOT = 0 will display screen text scrolling the simulation time, minimum timestep and volume conservation.

       LGPLOT = 1 will display nothing.
       Use this switch position with batch runs.

       LGPLOT = 2 displays the graphical floodwave progression over the grid system (flow depth)

       and inflow hydrograph.

   * - METRIC
     - s
     - **0 = English**

       **1 = Metric**
     - METRIC = 0 for English units and METRIC = 1 for the metric system of units.

   * - MSTREET
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - MSTREET = 1 to initiate the street flow component.
       The STREET.DAT file must be created (see comment 2).

   * - MUD
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - Set MUD = 0 for clear water and MUD = 1 for hyperconcentrated sediment flow.

       If MUD = 1 the sediment load (volume or concentration by volume) for either the

       floodplain hydrograph HP(I,J,3) or the channel hydrograph H(I,J,3)

       must be assigned to each inflow hydrograph pair (comments 1 and 3).

       The SED.DAT file must be created.

   * - NOPRTC
     - s
     - **0, 1 or 2**
     - If NOPRTC = 0, the BASE.OUT channel data is reported.

       If NOPRTC = 1, the BASE.OUT channel outflow data is not reported.

       If NOPRTC = 2, the BASE.OUT file is not reported.

   * - NOPRTFP
     - s
     - **0, 1, 2 or 3**
     - If NOPRTFP = 0, the BASE.OUT floodplain flow data is reported.

       If NOPRTFP = 1, the BASE.OUT floodplain outflow data is not reported.

       If NOPRTFP = 2, BASE.OUT is not written.
       This reduces the time for writing model output.

       If NOPRTFP = 3, only floodplain outflow data is reported to the BASE.OUT file.

   * - SHALLOWN
     - r
     - **0 = off**

       **0.1 - 0.99**
     - Flow roughness n-value for shallow overland flow (flow depth < 0.2 ft or 0.06 m) (see comment 9).

   * - SIMUL
     - r
     - **0.01 -** Infinity
     - Simulation time (hours).

   * - STARTIMTEP
     - r
     - **0 to ENDTIM- TEP**
     - Start time for the time series output data (hours).
       Set this value to any time 0 to ENDTIMTEP.

       It should represent the delayed start of time dependent data.

   * - SWMM
     - s
     - **0 = off**

       **1 = on**
     - SWMM = 1 initiates the FLO-2D storm drain model.

   * - TIMTEP
     - r
     - **0 - 100**
     - Output interval (hrs) that the flow depth, resolved velocity, x-velocity, y-velocity and

       water surface elevation datasets are reported to the TIMDEP.OUT file for a post-simulation

       flood animation.

       TIMTEP should be a multiple of TOUT.The switch ITIMTEP is required.

   * - TOUT
     - r
     - **0.01 - 24.**
     - Output interval (hrs) that hydraulic data is reported to the various output files \*.OUT.

   * - XARF
     - r
     - **0.
       - 1.**
     - Global area reduction factor applied to all grid elements. This factor reduces the

       grid element surface area available for flood volume storage.

       XARF can be used to account irregular surface topography, dense vegetation or other features.

       Range: 0 < XARF < 1.
       A typical value for XARF of 0.10 indicates that 10% of each grid element surface is not

       avail- able for flood storage.

       The XARF value is overridden by the ARF variable specified for the individual grid elements

       in the ARF.DAT file.

       Assign XARF = 0. to flood the entire surface area of the grid elements.

   * - XCONC
     - r
     - **0 - 0.60**
     - Volumetric concentration to bulk the inflow discharge hydrograph (channel or floodplain).

       For example, set XCONC = 0.20 for a concentration of 20% by volume. This will account

       for sediment bulking without initiating the hyperconcentrated sediment transport routine.

       If simulating clear water flooding, set XCONC = 0.

       If MUD = 2, XCONC is the global mudflow or tailings sediment concentration by volume.


**Instructional Comments**

**CONT.DAT File**

These instructions will aid in assigning of the CONT.DAT file parameters:

   1. If any of the switches MUD, ISED, IRAIN, IMULT, INFIL, MSTREET, LEVEE, ICHANNEL, IWRFS, IMODFLOW, SWMM or
      IHYDRSTRUCT are set to 0 “off”, then the corresponding data file can be omitted. For example,
      set MSTREET = 0 and the STREET.DAT file can be omitted.

   2. Streets, groundwater, mudflow, levees, and rill and gully flow can be simulated with or without a channel.

   3. Supercritical flow is uncommon on alluvial surfaces and may be inhibited by sediment entrainment.
      There are three possible approaches to a high Froude number flow analysis:

       a. Allow supercritical flow and do not limit the Froude number.

       b. Increase the grid element roughness by assigning AMANN or setting higher individual grid element n-values to reduce the Froude number (assign
          spatially variable n-values).

       c. Set the Limiting Froude number or the floodplain (e.g. set FROUDL = 0.99 or 1.11).
          When FROUDL is exceeded the grid element roughness value will be increased by 0.001 for the next timestep.
          After a flood simulation, review ROUGH.OUT to determine where FROUDL was exceeded and the maximum n-values
          for that cell were computed.
          Consider revising the n-values in the MANNINGS_N.DAT file to match those in the ROUGH.OUT file.
          This will ensure that FROUDL is not exceeded.
          Re- name the MANNINGS_N.RGH file to MANNINGS_N.DAT.

       d. Spatially variable limiting Froude numbers can also be assigned to individual grid elements in FPFROUDE.DAT.

       e. The shallow n-value is off when SHALLOWN = 0. or when AMANN = -99.
          The limiting Froude number is off if you set FROUDL = 0.for the floodplain.
          AMANN= -99 turns off the depth variable n-value, but not the limiting Froude number n-value adjustments.

   4. The floodwave travel time should be reviewed to determine if it is appropriate.
      The travel time can also be used to calibrate the n-values.
      Adjusting n-values with FROUDL will slow the arrival of the frontal wave.
      During the hydro- graph recessional limb when the Froude number is less than 0.5 and the flow is shallow,
      the n-value decreases by 0.0005 until the original n-value is reached.

   5. IFLOODWAY initiates the floodway routine.
      Flow will not be exchanged be- tween floodplain grid elements unless the maximum water surface plus the
      encroachment depth (ENCROACH) from a previous FLO-2D simulation is exceeded.
      An initial FLO-2D simulation is required to establish the maximum water surface elevations.
      See the Floodway discussion in the Reference Manual component section.
      IFLOODWAY is also used to set up the base flood condition for reporting flood arrival time and peak arrival time.
      Run the model twice in the same folder.
      The first run should establish the baseflow condition so do not use the breach hydrographs or breach conditions
      in the first run.
      The second run uses DEPFP.OUT to set the base flood condition so that the flood arrival times can be calculated
      in the file BASEFLOWFP_TIME.OUT.

   6. If channel flow is simulated (ICHANNEL = 1), then the NOPRTC variable must be set in CONT.DAT.
      In addition, channel outflow control can be as- signed in OUTFLOW.DAT.

   7. ITIMTEP will enable a simple animation (time and space output) of the over- land flow to be displayed in Mapper,
      MAXPLOT or other map software.
      The animation will be based on a time interval TIMTEP specified by the user.

   8. The depth duration analysis is used to determine how long a floodplain grid element is inundated at a flow depth
      greater than the DEPTHDUR variable.
      If DEPTHDUR = 1 ft, the output file DEPTHDUR.OUT has the total du- ration in hours that the depth exceeded 1 ft.
      The results can be reviewed in MAXPLOT.
      If the depth duration analysis is activated, then a second output file DEPTHDURATION2.OUT is generated for the
      cumulative time duration above 2 ft (0.61 m).

   9. To improve the timing of the floodwave progression through the grid system, a depth variable roughness can be
      assigned.
      The basic equation for the grid element roughness nd as function of flow depth is:

        nd = nb \*1.5 \* e\ :sup:`-(0.4 depth/dmax)`

        where:

            nb = bankfull discharge roughness depth = flow depth

            dmax = flow depth for drowning the roughness elements and vegetation (hardwired 3 ft or 1 m)

   This equation prescribes that the variable depth floodplain roughness is equal to the assigned flow roughness for complete submergence of all
   roughness elements (assumed to be 3 ft or 1 m).
   This equation is applied by the model as a default and the user can turn ‘off’ the depth roughness adjustment coefficient for all grid elements by
   assigning AMANN = -99.
   This roughness adjustment will slow the progression of the floodwave.
   It is valid for flow depths ranging from 0.5 ft (0.15 m) to 3 ft (1 m).
   For example, at 1 ft (0.3 m), the computed roughness will be about 1.31 times the assigned roughness for a flow depth of 3 ft.
   Assigning a ROUGHADJ value may reduce unexpected high Froude numbers.

   The following rules apply:

    .. raw:: html

       0.0 &lt; flow depth &lt; 0.2 ft (0.06 m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = SHALLOWN value<br>
       0.2 ft (0.06 m) &lt; flow depth &lt; 0.5 ft (0.15 m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = SHALLOWN/2.<br>
       0.5 ft (0.15 m) &lt; flow depth &lt; 3 ft (1 m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = nb *1.5* e<sup>-(0.4 depth/dmax)</sup><br>
       3 ft (1 m) &lt; flow depth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n = n-value in MANNINGS_N.DAT

   10. The IBACKUP = 1 switch is used to create a backup file with an \*.BAC extension. The\*.BAC files can be reviewed to see if the model
       is correctly reading the data.This is a data file format troubleshooting tool. These files can be renamed to \*.DAT and the model can
       be run with them.
       IBACKUP = 1 will also generate a series of binary files that represent the model results at the last output interval.
       The binary files are overwritten at the end of each output inter- val so if the model is terminated prior to the end of the run for
       any reason, the simulation can be restarted from the last interval.
       Setting the switch to 1 can significantly lengthen the model run time.
       Setting IBACKUP = 2 will write all elevation changes associated with the outflow nodes and channel top-of-bank revisions to
       the FPLAIN.RGH file which can be renamed to the FPLAIN.DAT file to run the model.

   11. The DEPRESSDEPTH parameter can be used to either identify depressed elements or low levee crest elevations.
       Set SIMUL = 0.01 hrs for separate values for each filter.
       Set DEPRESSDEPTH = 3.0 ft to review the depressed elements in the DEPRESSED_ELEMENTS.OUT ﬁle, rename the file and reassign
       DEPRESSDEPTH to 1.0 ft or so and rerun the model to generate LOW_LEVEE\_ CREST_ELEVATIONS.OUT ﬁle.

   12. If a grid element is lower than every neighboring cell, to the depth of DE- PRESSDEPTH, the grid element is considered to be a
       topographical depression and a probable error.
       The grid element is listed in DEPRESSED_ELE- MENTS.OUT file.

   13. DEPRESSDEPTH is also used to identify levees that have a low crest elevation.
       A levee or wall that is only 0.1 ft above the ground is superfluous.
       The low levee warning message and action has three options:

          a. DEPRESSDEPTH = 0.0 to 10.0 ft; Identifies the wall with a crest elevation lower than DEPRESSDEPTH in LOW_LEVEE_CREST\_ ELEVATIONS.OUT
             file.
          b. DEPRESSDEPTH = -1.0 to - 10.0 ft; Assesses the side of the wall where the crest elevation is assigned to determine if the
             levee height is lower than the DEPRESSDEPTH value.
          c. DEPRESSDEPTH = -101.0 to -110.0 ft; Assesses both sides of the wall to determine if the height is lower than DEPRESSDEPTH
             (1 ft to 10 ft).
          d. If DEPRESSDEPTH is negative, LEVEE.BAC file is written as a backup file omitting the low levees that can be renamed as LEVEE. DAT.

   14. Multiple channels IMULTC have various conditions depending on the switch position and which multiple channel data files exist.
       If IMULTC = 1, the engine checks for MULT.DAT, and SIMPLE_MULT.DAT.
       Data can be as- signed to both files for separate grid elements.
       If IMULTC = 2, then multiple channels can be used alongside separate gutter cells in GUTTER.DAT.

Variable Descriptions for the TOLER.DAT File

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

VARIABLE FMT RANGE DESCRIPTION

COURANTC

r

0. 2 - 0.9 Courant number for channels.
   Courant-Friedrich-Lewy numerical stability parameter that relates the floodwave movement in channels to the discretized model in space and time (see
   comments 3 thru 5).

COURANTFP

r

0.2 - 0.9 Courant number for floodplain.
Numerical stability parameter that relates the floodwave movement for overland flow to the discretized model in space and time (see comments 3 thru
5).

COURANTST

r

0.2 - 0.9 Courant number for streets.
Courant number for floodplain.
Numerical stability parameter that relates the floodwave movement in streets to the discretized model in space and time.
(see comments 3 thru 5).

COURCHAR

c

C, T Character ‘C’ that identifies Line 2 with the Courant stability parameter.
This variable is case sensitive.
It must be upper case.

DEPTOL

r

0.1 - 0.5 Tolerance value for the percent change in the flow depth for a given timestep.
When a given element DEPTOL is exceeded, the timestep will be reduced.
If DEPTOL = 0, then the timestep is governed by the Courant numerical stability criteria.
It is recommended that DEPTOL only be used for specific ponded flow conditions where the Courant number is ineffective (see comment 2).

TIME_ACCEL

r

0.1 to 2 Coefficient to increase the rate of incremental timestep change.
Default value = 0.1 A value of 0.1 may result in a a more stable simulation time.
A value of 0.2 or higher may result in a faster simulation.

TOLGLOBAL

r 0.004 - 0.5

typ 0.0012 -

0.03 Surface detention.
TOLGLOBAL is a minimum value of the flow depth for flood routing.
A typical value river flooding is 0.10 ft (see comment 1).
Use a small value for rainfall runoff (0.004 ft to 0.10 ft; 0.0012 m to 0.030m).

Instructional Comments for the TOLER.DAT File

1. The TOLGLOBAL value prescribes the flow depth for a floodplain or channel grid element below which no flood routing will be performed.
   TOLGLOBAL is analogous to a depression storage rainfall abstraction.
   The TOLGLOBAL value for streets is hardwired (0.03 ft or 0.01 m).
   TOLSPATIAL is another variable that can be assigned to any cell.
   The TOLSPATIAL variable will re- place TOLGLOBAL if assigned.
   See TOLSPATIAL tab for further instructions.

2. DEPTOL controls the percent change in grid element or channel flow depth for a given timestep.
   It is a generic control that eliminates further analysis of the numerical stability criteria.
   DEPTOL affects the computer runtime and flow depth resolution.
   The Courant is the primary numerical stability control.
   For some models with ponded flow, the water surface and velocities for low n-value may exhibit numerical instability.
   Using or decreasing DEPTOL will reduce the timestep and, improve the numerical stability and result in longer computational times.
   Setting DEPTOL = 0 dictates that only the Courant criteria will be applied for numerical stability.

3. To identify numerical instability, review the CHANMAX.OUT file and the HYDROG program hydrograph plots for hydrograph spikes.
   Review MAX- PLOT or Mapper or the VELTIMEFP.OUT file to determine if floodplain velocities are too high.

4. If the model is unstable, reduce the appropriate Courant number by 0.1 in successive runs until the Courant number reaches 0.2.

5. Using the Courant criteria, the timestep Δt is limited by: Δt = C Δx / (βV + c)

where:

C is the Courant number (C ≤ 1.0) Δx is the square grid element width

V is the computed average cross section velocity

β is a coefficient (e.g. 5/3 for a wide channel) but is seldom used c is the computed wave celerity

The Courant coefficient C may vary from 0.2 to 0.9 depending on the size of the grid element and floodwave velocity.
If C is set to 1.0, artificial or numerical diffusivity is assumed to be zero.
A typical value of the Courant number is 0.6 to

0.7.
Start with the default value of 0.6.

Use the following approach to improve numerical stability:

· Initially run the model with the Courant numbers = 0.6.
If the model is unstable, reduce the appropriate Courant number by 0.1 increments in successive runs until the Courant number reaches 0.2.

· Run the model with an appropriate limiting Froude number (e.g. FROUDL in CONT>DAT = 0.9 subcritical flow on an alluvial surface).
This will calibrate the model n-values for reasonable Froude numbers.

· Review the maximum velocities in VELTIMEC.OUT, VELTIMEFP.
OUT and VELTIMEST.OUT (or in MAXPLOT or Mapper) and the maximum Froude numbers in SUPER.OUT to determine the location of any inappropriate high
velocities related to numerical surging and increase the n-values in the vicinity of the grid elements with high velocities.

· Review the n-values in ROUGH.OUT and MANNINGS_N.DAT.
Make n-value adjustments in MANNINGS_N.DAT based on exceedingly high n-values in ROUGH.OUT then replace MANNINGS_NDAT with MANNINGS.RGH.

· Run the simulation and repeat steps 3 and 4 making adjustments to MANNINGS_N.DAT until ROUGH.OUT is essentially empty.
A few incremental n-value changes will not affect the simulation.
Make adjustments to FROUDL to decrease the number of n-value adjustments.

6. Increase the model speed:

· Increase the Courant numbers in 0.1 increments until C = 0.9.

· Increase the TIME_ACCEL parameter in TOLER.DAT in 0.1 increments to increase the computational timesteps increments.

· Review the model numerical stability with the maximum velocity and Froude number output files.
Decrease the TIME_ACCEL parameter if unreasonable increases in the maximum velocity and Froude number are reported.

· Review the computational runtime in the SUMMARY.OUT file and balance the increased Courant numbers and TIME_ACCEL parameter to achieve the best
runtime.
This may require only an increase in TIME_AC- CEL.

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

VARIABLE FMT RANGE DESCRIPTION

DUM

i

1 - NNOD Grid element number (I) of the floodplain grid system.
This is a dummy variable that is not used by the model.
It is only used for the convenience of viewing the input data file.

FP(I,J)

i

1 - NNOD Floodplain element contiguous to grid element I (where I = 1, NNOD) and located in the J-direction (where J = 1,4).
The J-direction corresponds to one of the four compass directions (see comments 1 thru 5).

FP(I,5) r 0.010 - 0.4 Manning’s n roughness coefficient assigned to grid element I (see comment 6).

FP(I,6) r

Ground surface elevation for grid element I (ft or m).

IMPORTANT NOTE: If a grid size, shape, elevation or roughness is adjusted with the FLO-2D Plugin, the exported data will not overwrite FPLAIN.DAT,
CADPTS.DAT, or NEIGHBORS.DAT.
Those files should be deleted prior to running the engine.

FLOPRO.EXE reads the grid, elevation, and Manning’s n data as follows: The model verifies the following files:

· If FPLAIN.DAT, CADPTS.DAT, and, NEIGHBORS.DAT, exist, the engine will use them and ignore TOPO.DAT AND MANNINGS_N.DAT.

· If TOPO exists, the model reads it to count the number of grid elements and grid element size.

· If NEIGHBORS.DAT exists, the model reads this file to define the neighbors.
If it does not exist, FLOPRO uses TOPO.DAT to define the neighbors and creates NEIGHBORS.DAT.
The model starts faster when the file is present.

· If MANNINGS_N.DAT exists, the model reads it to define the floodplain roughness.
If the file does not exist but all others do, the model will generate a fatal error message and stop.

· If CADPTS.DAT and FPLAIN.DAT do not exist, the model will generate them.

· If TOPO.DAT and MANNINGS_N.DAT do not exist, the model will use FPLAIN.DAT and CADPTS.DAT to create them.

Instructional Comments for the FPLAIN.DAT File

1. There should be no elements in the grid system that do not have at least one neighbor element sharing one side.
   In other words, no element should be connected only by a single diagonal corner.

2. The elements should be numbered consecutively starting with 1.

3. If a grid element (I) is a boundary element, then the neighboring grid element FP(I,J) where J = 1, 2, 3, or 4, is set equal to 0.

4. Any additional grid elements in the FPLAIN.DAT file must have corresponding grid elements in the CADPTS.DAT file.

5. The roughness assigned to the floodplain grid element should represent the flow resistance associated with a flow depth of 3 ft (1 m) or greater.
   The model automatically computes a depth variable roughness for depths less than 3 ft ap- proximately as follows:

nd = nb \*1.5 \* e-(0.4 depth/dmax)

where:

nb = bankfull discharge roughness depth = flow depth

dmax = flow depth for drowning the roughness elements and vegetation (hardwired 3 ft or 1 m)

To turn off the depth variable roughness set AMANN = -99.
See the Comment 9 in the CONT.DAT file.

MANNINGS_N.DAT File

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

Instructional Comments for the MANNINGS_N.DAT File

This file is prepared and edited by the FLO-2D Plugin for spatially variable n-values.

1. The elements should be numbered consecutively starting with 1.

2. The roughness assigned to the floodplain grid element should represent the flow resistance associated with a flow depth of 3 ft (1 m) or greater.

3. This file is a substitute for the n-values listed in the FPLAIN.DAT.

4. MANNING_N.DAT, MANNING_N.BAC, MANNING_N.RGH: This

series of files is automatically generated by the FLO Pro model and has the format of grid element number and Manning’s n-value in two columns.
When combined with TOPO.DAT, MANNINGS_N.DAT can be used as a substitute for FPLAIN.DAT.
FPLAIN.DAT can be deleted or not used if these two files are present in the project folder.
The model will recognize that either the TOPO.DAT and MANNINGS_N.DAT files or the FPLAIN.DAT is present and will automatically generate the missing
file(s).
These files can be used to assigned or edit the n-values.
TOPO.DAT and MANNINGS_N.DAT are in a format that is more GIS compatible and FPLAIN.DAT is therefore obsolete.
MANNINGS_N.RGH is used with the limiting Froude number component to report adjusted n-values during a simulation in place of FPLAIN.RGH.

XCOORD(I) r

X coordinate of grid element node at center.

YCOORD(I) r

Y coordinate of grid element node at center.

ELEV(I) r

Elevation of grid element.

Instructional Comments for the TOPO.DAT File

1. The TOPO.DAT data as that contained in FPLAIN.DAT and CADPTS.DAT and is in a format that enables GIS and CADD applications to use it directly.

The first hydrograph time-discharge set should be 0.0 and 0.0.

HP(I,J,2) r 0.0 - Floodplain discharge (cfs or cms) corresponding to the time interval which starts at HP(I,J,1).

HP(I,J,3) r 0 - 1 Sediment concentration by volume or sediment volume for a mudflow simulation (see comment 2).

HYDCHAR

H Character ‘H’ that identifies Line 3 inflow hydrograph time and discharge pairs.
Each line of the hydrograph begins with ‘H’.
Variable is case sensitive.
It must be upper case.

IDEPLT

i

1 - NNOD Inflow grid element number whose hydrograph is to be graphically displayed at runtime.
Only one inflow grid element hydrograph can be plotted on the screen.

VARIABLE FMT RANGE DESCRIPTION

IHOURDAILY

s 0 = hourly

1 = daily IHOURDAILY = 0 for inflow hydrograph hourly intervals HP (I,J,1).
IHOURDAILY = 1 for daily (24hr) intervals of HP (I,J,1).

KHIN(I) i 1 - NNOD Array of grid elements with a inflow hydrograph (in- flow nodes).

RESCHAR

c

R Character ‘R’ that identifies Line 4 for reservoir or ponded area water surface assignment.

Variable is Case Sensitive.
It must be upper case.

IRESGRID

i

1 - NNOD Grid element located somewhere inside the reservoir or ponded water area.
Only one grid element has to be assigned a water surface elevation (see comment 5).

RESERVOIREL

r 0 -

0 - (- ) Water surface elevation (ft or m) of the reservoir or ponded water area.

Negative water surface elevation assigns the reservoir bed elevations below the breach foundation elevation as dead pool ground and re- duces the
reservoir starting flow depth for those dead pool elements.

RESERVOIRN

r

0.1 - 0.4 Optional reservoir n-value for all reservoir elements assigned a starting water surface elevation.
If RES- ERVOIRN is not assigned, the model will use the floodplain element n- value.
The n-value should be high enough to reduce reservoir velocities to less than

2.0 fps (0.67 mps).
A value of 0.25 is suggested (see

Comment 6).

TAILINGSELEV(II) r 0 - Tailings dam material surface elevation (ft or m).

Instructional Comments for the INFLOW.DAT File

1. Either the channel or the floodplain grid elements can be used to input the inflow hydrograph to grid system.

2. The user has a choice to input either the sediment concentration by volume associated with the inflow water discharge or a sediment volume for the
   time interval HP(I,J,1).
   The mudflow volume (ft3 or m3) can represent erosion, hillslope failure, or any other type of mass sediment loading.
   When HP(I,J,3) is less than 1.0, HP (I,J,3) corresponds to the sediment concentration by volume for floodplain discharge HP(I,J,2) for the time
   interval which starts at HP(I,J,1).
   If HP(I,J,3) is greater than 1.0, then HP(I,J,3) represents a sediment inflow volume.
   If a mudflow scenario is being used each hydrograph should have concentration data.
   If one hydrograph does not have mudflow, give it the minimum amount of 0.10 concentration.

3. IDEPLT must be an inflow grid element KHIN(I) listed in Line 2.

4. If the channel inflow hydrograph is to be plotted at runtime on the screen.
   Set LGPLOT = 2 in the CONT.DAT file.

5. To create a filled reservoir, pond, or tailings dam, simply assign the desired water or tailings surface elevation to one grid element (IRESGRID)
   within the reservoir or ponded area.
   At model runtime, the model will automatically as- sign the same water surface to all the grid elements in an expanding circle of elements around
   IRESGRID that have a ground elevation less than the prescribed water surface elevation RESERVOIREL and/or the tailings surface elevation
   TAILINGSELEV(II).

6. Flooding routing a deep reservoir pool is essentially frictionless flow and should not be simulated using a friction slope given by Manning’s equation.
   Friction- less flow cannot be predicted with the full dynamic equation without a friction slope term.
   In order to apply the revised Manning’s equation for ponded flow, it is recommended that a high n-value be used on the order of 0.1 to 0.4.
   This will result in reservoir velocities of approximately 1 fps (0.3 mps) which will be representing for filling or draining the reservoir when the
   water surface slope is almost flat.
   RESERVOIRN is a required variable in Build 22 and on.

7. INOUTFC can be set up for a floodplain or channel inflow, diversion, sink, source, or MODFLOW conditions.

a. INOUTFC = 0; Floodplain inflow hydrograph, a cell can be either source or sink at a given time, for this condition.
   The grid cell can become a source

at one time-step and a sink at another time-step during a simulation.
Sink (negative) and sources (positive) at a given time.

b. INOUTFC = 1; Floodplain diversion will be removed from the cell but not added to groundwater.

c. INOUTFC = 2; Floodplain node, the source of this discharge comes from groundwater.
   The following source flow condition at a given time step will be added to the surface grid.

d. INOUTFC = 3; Floodplain, this sink flow condition is subtracted from the surface grid.
   If the cell is dry, no outflow will be subtracted from the cell.
   If the discharge at the grid cell is less than the sink outflow condition, then only the available flow in the cell is subtracted from the surface.

e. INOUTFC = 0; Channel inflow hydrograph a cell can either be a source or a sink for this condition.
   The channel cross section can become a source at one time-step and a sink at another time-step during a simulation.
   Sink (negative) and sources (positive) at a given time.

f. INOUTFC = 1; Channel, the diversion will act as a sink but not added to ground water.

g. INOUTFC = 2; MODFLOW Source (See Comment 8).
   Channel node, the source of this discharge comes from groundwater.
   The source flow will be added to the cross-section flow.

h. INOUTFC = 3; MODFLOW Sink (See Comment 8).
   Channel, the sink of this discharge condition to groundwater from the channel cross section.

8. A floodplain cell can be either source or sink at a given time-step.
   It may be source at one time-step and sink at another time-step during a simulation.
   They cannot be channel bank elements or interior channel elements.
   Q (+) for source to surface water.
   Q (-) to sinks for surface water.

9. Source and sink discharges from/to groundwater for an uncoupled simulation.
   A source and sink discharge cannot be assigned to the same channel element.
   The channel element is either a source or a sink, but it cannot be both.
   That means that if you have a switch occur in a reach from source to sink, you will need to select those channel elements that you want to be sources
   and those you want to be sinks.
   You can just assign a group of channel elements as a source and another group as a sink in the reach and assign different times.

10.
To create a tailing dam storage area with uniform tailings surface, the tailings elevation or depth should be assigned to the grid element (IRESGRID).
At model runtime, the model will automatically assign the same tailings surface or tailings depth to all the grid elements that are inside the
tailings dam storage area.

500 pairs Array of time intervals (hrs) for the grid element stage-time relationship.

STA_STAGE(J) r 0.0 -

500 pairs Array of water surface elevations (ft or m) for the stage-time relationship.

Instructional Comments for the OUTFLOW.DAT File

1. Either the channel or the floodplain outflow elements can be used to discharge the flow off the grid system.
   The outflow node is an artificial grid element whose sole purpose is to discharge flow off the grid system.
   The outflow nodes should not contain hydraulic structures, streets or other attributes.
   The flood- plain elevation of the outflow node is automatically set to an elevation lower (0.25 ft or 0.1 m) than the lowest upstream grid element
   unless it is already lower than all the upstream grid elements.

2. Omitting Lines 2 and 3 will cause all the inflow to the outflow elements to dis- charge from the grid system at normal flow conditions.
   This outflow is equal to the sum of the inflow from the contiguous elements that are not outflow nodes and enables an approximation of normal flow
   depth in the outflow elements.
   This is a simple method to ensure that backwater related to artificial boundary conditions does not occur in the upstream elements.

3. Channel boundary outflow condition may be established by specifying a stage- discharge relationship given by Q = a hb where the coefficient (a) and
   exponent

(b) are required input and h is the flow depth.
The coefficient (a) and exponent

(b) can be used to established critical flow at the outflow grids.

4. A discretized time-stage relationship can be employed to specify a water surface elevation for at various channel or floodplain locations in the grid
   system.
   This is a simple method by which to simulate storm surge flooding on the coastal floodplain.
   Floodplain or channel elements can be specified with increasing tides or storm surge water surface elevations.

5. If coastal flooding (storm surges or tsunamis) is being simulated with a time- stage hydraulic control, assign the time-stage control to the outflow
   nodes.
   When the time-stage water surface elevation in OUTFLOW.DAT is higher than the model predicted stage, inflow to the grid system will occur with as-
   signed time-stage elevation to the outflow node.
   If the model predicted water surface is higher than the assigned time-stage elevation, the grid element will function as an outflow node discharging
   flow off the grid system.
   It is permissible to assign NOSTA time-stage control to grid elements that are not outflow nodes.

6. If a water surface elevation is specified for a NOSTA element, determine if it is an inflow element in the INFLOW.DAT file.
   If NOSTA is an inflow element, set NOSTA as negative value to compute the inflow volume at this element which corresponds to the constant water
   surface elevation.

7. If the OUTCHAR is O1-O9, these outflow grid elements will generate hydrographs that can be used as inflow hydrographs to a separate downstream FLO-2D
   model with a different grid system (even if the downstream system has a different element size).
   The inflow hydrograph will be in the format of the INFLOW.DAT file.
   This enables a row or column of outflow grid elements to be defined as inflow elements to the downstream grid system.
   Up to nine separate additional grid systems can be used.
   If only one downstream grid system will have the inflow hydrographs, set OUTCHAR = O1 for those boundary outflow nodes.
   The CADPTS.DAT file for the downstream grid system must be included in the project folder as CADPTSDS1.

comment 3).

2 = E 6 = SE

3 = S 7 = SW

4 = W 8 = NW

IRAINREAL

s

0 = off

1 = on IRAINREAL = 1 indicates that real-time rainfall (e.g. NEXRAD) will be simulated.
The RAINCELL.DAT file containing the spatial and temporal rainfall data must be prepared by the FLO-2D Plugin.

IRGRID

1 - NNOD Grid element with a spatially defined rainfall depth area reduction value.
This data is automatically generated in the FLO-2D Plugin.

MOVING- STORM s 0 = off

1 = on MOVINGSTORM = 1 indicates that a moving storm will be simulated.

RAINABS r 0 - 1 Rainfall interception and abstraction (inches or mm) if infiltration is not being modeled (see comment 2).

RAINARF

r

0 - 1 Rainfall depth area reduction to create spatially variable rainfall.
This data is automatically generated in the FLO-2D Plugin (see comment 4).

RAINCHAR c R Character ‘R’ that identifies Line 3.
Variable is case sensitive and it must be upper case.

RAINSPEED r 0 - 100

0 - 50 Storm speed (mph or kph)

RTT r 0.0 - Total storm rainfall (inches or mm).

R_TIME(I) 0.0 - Time (hrs) corresponding to the start of the specified rainfall interval.

R_DISTR(I)

r

0 - 1 Rainfall distribution as a cumulative percentage of the total storm which initiates at the time interval R_TIME(I) (see comment 1).

Instructional Comments for the RAIN.DAT File

1. The rainfall distribution has to be correlated to the flood simulation time.
   The rainfall may occur for only a portion of the total flood simulation and may start after the flood simulation begins.
   For most rain storms, the start of the simulation correlates with the start of the rainfall.
   In those cases where the rainfall and the simulation time are not correlated, it may be necessary to use

0.0 cumulative rainfall at the beginning of the flood simulation for a period of time.
Similarly the final cumulative rainfall at the end of the simulation could be set equal to 1.0.

2. If infiltration is being simulated, set the RAINABS = 0 and assign the rainfall abstraction in the INFIL.DAT file.

3. When rainfall occurs on a grid element with a complete storage loss assigned (ARF = 1 value), the model removes that rainfall volume from the surface
   water in that cell.
   It assumes that the rainfall on buildings enters the storm drain system and is eliminated as runoff.
   Setting IRAINBUILDING = 1 enables the model to add the building rainfall to the surface water of the grid element with an ARF value.
   It assumes that the buildings have a gutter system that discharges the water to the ground.

4. RAINARF values are used for design storm data.
   The variable is a percentage of the total depth for the cell or the total depth for the cell when using a design storm event in the RAIN.DAT file.
   For example, set the variable to zero, no rain will fall on the cell.
   Set it to 0.5, half of the assigned rainfall on that element will be computed for that interval and set the RAINARF value to 1 and all of the rain
   will fall on the cell.
   The realtime rainfall (spatially and temporally variable) is also reduced by the RAINARF value over each rainfall interval.

Instructional Comments for the RAINCELL.DAT File

1. Real-time rainfall, specifically NEXRAD rainfall data, is rainfall information that varies both in space and time and is applied to individual cells
   within a grid system.
   The rainfall data is usually recorded at fifteen-minute intervals over a specific duration.
   All the relevant data for this rainfall, forming a comprehensive dataset, is stored within the RAINCELL.DAT file.

2. Rainfall data obtained from radar systems is typically collected on relatively large grids, such as 400 m by 400 m, 1 km by 1 km, or even larger, like
   2 km by 2 km grid resolutions.
   To determine the rainfall amount at each FLO-2D grid cell for a specific time interval and rainfall period, the NEXRAD grid cells are overlaid with
   the FLO-2D grid cells.
   The comprehensive dataset resulting from this process is stored in the RAINCELL.DAT data file.
   This file can be generated using the FLO-2D QGIS plugin.

3. A small sample of the catalog data is shown below.
   7/13/2008 10:00 7/13/2008 15:00 1 5

C:\\Projects\\NexRAD\\Min5.asc

4. The timestamp is not used by the FLO-2D Plugin or FLOPRO.EXE engine.
   It is a reference variable.
   It can be used to synchronize the raincell storm data to inflow hydrographs.

5. RAINCELL data is also stored as RAINCELL.HDF5.
   Realtime rainfall (NEXRAD rainfall data) is spatially and temporally variable rainfall data that is applied to each cell of the grid system.
   A complete dataset is stored in the data file RAINCELL.HDF5 using a Hierarchical binary Data Format.
   The HDF5 data is primarily stored using two types of objects: datasets and groups.

Instructional Comments for the FLO2DRAINCELL.DAT File

1. This data file stores the intersected real time rainfall grid (NEXRAD Grid) for each FLO-2D grid cell.
   The real time rainfall data (NEXRAD) are typically collected on large grids like 1 km by 1 km or even larger.
   FLO-2D cells are in the order of 10 ft (3 m) to 100 ft (30 m).
   The FLO2DRainCell.dat has two columns, the first column is the FLO-2D grid element number and the second column is the real time rainfall grid that
   intersects the FLO-2D grid cell.
   The FLO2DRainCell.dat and RainCellRaw.dat files serve as an alternative to the RAINCELL.DAT or RAINCELL.HDF5 files, providing a second option to
   assign real-time rainfall data into the simulation.

Instructional Comments for the INFIL.DAT File

1. The Green-Ampt infiltration parameters including hydraulic conductivity HYDC, initial abstraction ABSTR, initial saturation SATI, and soil capillary
   suction head SOILS, can be estimated from the tables in the FLO-2D Reference Manual (Tables 3-6).
   Generally, the final SATF can be set at 100% and the porosity can be assumed to be 0.4.

2. No infiltration is simulated if the sediment concentration by volume is greater than 10%.
   This precludes simulating infiltration during mudflows.

3. Floodplain grid elements with unique Green-Ampt infiltration parameters are specified in Line 6 which supersede then global values in Line 2.

4. No infiltration is computed for the portion of the grid element removed from the potential flow surface with an Area Reduction Factor (ARF).
   No infiltration is computed for grid elements that are completely removed from the potential flow surface (ARF = 1.0).
   Rainfall runoff, however, is assumed to occur for an ARF = 1 grid element if IRAINBUILDING = 1 in the RAIN.DAT file.
   Increased runoff resulting from proposed development can be predicted by using the ARF values to limit infiltration on a grid element.

5. No infiltration is computed for street areas of a grid element.
   The street area is subtracted from the overland portion of the grid system.

6. Channel infiltration is computed only if INFCHAN = 1.
   Generally channel infiltration is negligible for channels with perennial flow.
   The simulation of channel infiltration may be important for small flood events in ephemeral alluvial fan channels with porous bed material.

7. Precipitation abstraction is an initial loss of rainfall that precedes infiltration and excess rainfall runoff.
   Vegetation interception is a component of the initial loss.
   Abstraction values will generally range from 0.01 to 0.5 inches.
   In addition, FLO-2D does not initiate any flood routing until the depression storage TOL is filled.
   The TOL value is specified in TOLER.DAT file.
   Abstraction is often assumed to include depression storage, but in FLO-2D a TOL value of ranging from 0.004 to 0.1 ft (0.001 to 0.03 m) represents the
   depression storage.

8. Use HYDCX(IC) and all other parameters on Line 4 to specify channel infiltration data by reach.
   Use line 8 HYDCON parameter to specify spatially variable hydraulic conductivity in the channel grid elements that will supersede the HYDCX(IC) value
   in Line 4.
   It is not necessary to specify individual channel

element soil suction, initial or final saturation values when assigning channel infiltration.
If SOILD is = 0, use Line 4, where IC is the number of channel segments or reaches each entered on a new line.
If SOILD is greater than 0, use line 4a where IC is the number of segments or reaches.

9. If SCS curve number method (INFMETHOD = 2) is used, it is assumed that the channel infiltration is negligible.
   Simulate channel infiltration with the Green-Ampt method.

10.
With the SCS curve number method (INFMETHOD = 2), assign the AB- STRSCS variable in Line 5 to the abstraction (inches or mm).
If ABSTRSCS = 0.0, the abstraction value is automatically computed using the SCS method.

11.
The infiltration parameters can be estimated from the tables in the Reference Manual.
The user must distinguish whether soil moisture deficit parameter DTHETA will represent the volumetric soil moisture deficit (soil moisture deficit
times the porosity) as prescribed from a drainage manual or if DTHETA will be defined as just the soil moisture deficit (SATF-SATI).
If the volumetric soil moisture deficit (SATF-SATI)*POROS is being applied, set POROS = 0.0 in Line 1 and assign a DTHETA value in the range from 0.0
to 0.5.
If the only soil moisture deficit is being used, then assign a typical porosity (POROS) in the range: 0.35 to 0.45.

12.
The Green-Ampt infiltration will cease when the wetting front reaches the limiting soil depth either SOILD, SOIL_DEPTH or SOIL_DEPTHCX for the
channel.

13.
It is not necessary to specify the soil suction, initial or final saturation values when simulating channel infiltration.
These values are assumed not to be important to the channel bed seepage or bank infiltration.

14.
Horton’s infiltration model is defined by the equation:

f = fn + (fi - fn) e-at

Where:

f = infiltration rate at simulation time t from start of the rainfall fi = initial infiltration rate (in/hr)

fn = final infiltration rate (in/hr)

a = decay coefficient (1/sec)

t = time from start of rainfall (sec)

There are no metric equivalent values so if using Horton on a metric project, use in/hr even if IMETRIC = 1.

15.
As the channel infiltration storage fills, the infiltration rate declines but does not cease.
The decay of the hydraulic conductivity Hc from the initially as- signed hydraulic conductivity Hi to a final saturated hydraulic conductivity Hf is
based on the following equation:

Hc = Hf + (Hi - Hf) e-at

where:

a = decay coefficient hardwired to 0.00002, selected to have the decay from the initial to the final hydraulic conductivity over a 72 hr period with
the decay to half the original hydraulic conductivity in 12 hours.

t = time (seconds) from when the wetting front reaches the limiting soil depth

16.
Horton infiltration for Build23 and on requires an initial abstraction of inches to be assigned to Line 2 of the INFIL.DAT file..

Instructional Comments for the CHAN.DAT File

1. The channel bottom elevation is calculated by the model based on the input channel depth and the floodplain or bank elevation.

2. When DEPINITIAL > 0, an initial depth is specified for all the elements in that channel segment.
   Setting DEPINITIAL = -1 will assign starting and ending water surface elevations (WSELSTART and WSELEND, Line 3) for a channel segment beginning with
   channel element ISTART and ending with channel element IEND.
   Only one starting and ending water surface is allowed per channel segment.
   The water surface elevations are computed for the channel elements between the ISTART and IEND elements based on the interpolations of the channel
   length and the specified water surface elevations.

3. Dividing the channel into segments may simplify reviewing the results.
   Organize the CHAN.DAT from upstream to downstream.
   The order of the grid element numbers in the file is not important (e.g. upstream channel element 446 can precede downstream channel element 31).
   The channel grid elements must be contiguous in each segment.

4. If channel geometry is being simulated with regression relationships (SHAPE = ‘V’), then the area versus depth power relationships must be specified:

A = adb

Where:

A = area of the channel d = depth to thalweg

a = coefficient

b = exponent

Similar relationships are required for wetted perimeter and top width.
There is a limit of two channel geometry relationships per channel element.
A second geometry relationship may be useful if there is a significant change in the cross section (e.g. an island).
If two power relationships are used to represent a natural cross section, then the maximum depth (EXCDEP) to which the first relationship applies must
be specified.

The second regression applies when the flow depth is greater than EXCDEP, but does not include the lower flow area.
The two variable area cross section relationships are unique and separate.
The total cross section flow area is the sum of the lower flow and upper (second relationship) flow areas.
The channel top width is computed directly from the second relationship.
The area, wet- ted perimeter and top width are evaluated using the upper flow depth given

by total depth - EXCDEP.
To analyze the upper channel geometry using the XSEC program, only the cross section coordinates above the EXCDEP depth are used.

These channel geometry relationships apply only to flow depths that are less than the channel depth (lower than the top of bank).
When the flow depth exceeds the top of bank, then the channel geometry above bank is evaluated as a rectangle.
Abrupt transitions between contiguous channel elements should be avoided unless they actually exist.

5. A preprocessor program XSEC is available in the FLO-2D subdirectory to determine the regression coefficient and exponents (A1, A2, A11, A22, B1, B2,
   B11, B22, B2, C1,C11, C22) in Line 2b.

6. A cross section width can exceed the width of the grid element.
   For example, a channel cross section that is 100 ft wide can be used in a 20 ft grid system.
   The model automatically determines the number of grid elements required by a channel cross section.
   If the cross-section width exceeds 95% of the combined bank elements width or if there is less than 5% floodplain surface area left in the bank
   element after removing the channel surface area, the channel will extend the right bank over another grid element looking downstream.

7. Set the channel roughness to a reasonable n-value and then set the FROUDC variable to an appropriate value (e.g. 0.95 to ensure subcritical flow).
   FLO- 2D will adjust the roughness values according to the limiting Froude number criteria (see the ROUGH.OUT file).
   Changes to the channel n-values may be accepted by replacing the CHAN.DAT file with the CHAN.RGH file.
   Just delete the original CHAN.DAT file and rename the CHAN.RGH to CHAN.
   DAT.

8. The confluence can be made by the tributary joining either side of the main channel.
   List the tributary first and the main channel second in Line C.

9. Use the PROFILES program to review the channel slope and adjust the bed elevations to create a more uniform average channel reach slope.
   The PROFILES program can interpolate cross sections and slope for surveyed cross sections.

10.
The key to channel routing is to balance the relationship between the slope, flow area and roughness.
Channel routing is more stable if the natural cross section routing routine is used (SHAPE = N).
When one cross section is as- signed to several grid elements it will be necessary to interpolate both the slope and the cross-section geometry in the
PROFILES program to create a smooth average channel slope.
Review the PROFILES program instructions for cross section and channel bed slope interpolation.
If there is more than one surveyed cross section per channel element, use the one that has the greatest hydraulic control to represent the channel.

11.
At a channel confluence, the next downstream channel element bed elevation must be lower than the confluence bed elevation creating a positive slope
down- stream of the confluence.

12.
If different bank elevations are assigned, the model automatically extends the channel into separate grid elements, one grid element containing each
bank.
The model may be required to do this anyway if the channel is wider than the grid element.

13.
The first two channel elements in a segment should have a positive slope in the downstream direction.
This is important for inflow channel elements.
There should also be a positive slope into the channel outflow nodes.
This will im- prove the numerical stability around the inflow and outflow nodes.

14.
After deleting a channel element, remove the cross section for that channel element from the XSEC.DAT file and renumbered in the PROFILES program.
If cross sections are mixed with other channel geometry (trapezoidal or rectangular), the cross-section elements should be grouped into segments to
identify the reaches with similar channel geometry.

15.
Eliminate channel elements that have a XLEN less than 50% of the SIDE (grid element width).
This can be accomplished by connecting the channel elements across the diagonal and eliminating the middle channel element.

16.
If the channel routing is unstable or numerically surging, reduce the Courant number C in the TOLER.
DAT by 0.1.

17.
To improve the timing of the floodwave progression through the system, a depth variable roughness can be assigned on a reach basis.
The basic equation for the channel element roughness nd as function of flow depth is:

nd = nb a e-(b depth/dmax)

where:

nb = bankfull discharge roughness depth = flow depth

dmax = bankfull flow depth

a = 1/e-b

b = roughness adjustment coefficient prescribed by the user (0 to 1.2)

This equation prescribes that the variable depth channel roughness is equal to the roughness at bankfull discharge.
If the user assigns a ROUGHADJ value (from 0 to 1.2) as the roughness adjustment coefficient b for a given reach, the roughness will increase with a
decrease in flow depth.
The higher the coefficient b, the greater the increase in roughness.
This roughness adjustment will slow the progression of the floodwave by increasing the roughness for less than bankfull discharge.
The plane bed roughness set for bankfull discharge will not

be affected.
For example, if the depth is 20% of the bankfull discharge and the roughness adjustment coefficient b is set to 0.44, the hydraulic roughness
Manning’s n-value will be 1.4 times the roughness prescribed for bankfull flow.
Assigning a ROUGHADJ value may reduce high Froude numbers.

A channel spatially variable shallow n-value assigned to the depths less than 0.2 ft (0.067 m) is defined by applying the ROUGHADJ to each channel
reach.:

SHALLOWN = ROUGHADJ / 2

where: ROUGHADJ is assigned to line 1 of each channel segment.

18.
Instructions for creating the cross-section channel geometry data files are out- lined in Lesson 14 of the Workshop Lessons.
The lessons are found in the FLO-2D Pro Documentation folder.

19.
Surveyed water surfaces can be automatically compared with the predicted water surface in the PROFILES program by creating a WSTIME.DAT file.
This file contains a list of the channel element, water surface elevation and time.
Create this file to calibrate the model to known water surface elevation data.
The time of the surveyed water surface elevation must correspond to the model flood routing timing.

20.
Channel elements that are not intended to share discharge with the floodplain should be designated as NOEXCHANGE cells.
For these elements, no lateral exchange occurs: neither overbank discharge from the channel to the adjacent floodplain (left or right bank), nor
return flow from the floodplain to the channel.

Additionally, NOEXCHANGE can be applied to channel elements at the up- stream or downstream termini.
When this designation is used, flow will not enter the channel at the upstream end, nor exit at either the upstream or downstream ends.

This feature is particularly useful at the upstream end of a channel segment when an inflow hydrograph is applied at a node.
The FLO-2D engine will automatically set the first channel element as NOEXCHANGE if it has an inflow node assigned to it or if it has a hydraulic
structure assigned to it.
This ensures that the inflow is routed entirely downstream within the channel without spilling onto the floodplain.

Instructional Comments for the HYSTRUC.DAT File

1. There are two approaches for bridge flow, rating curve/table or computing the bridge flow hydraulics directly as free surface, pressure flow or
   pressure and weir flow.
   For the rating curves, the hydraulic structure discharge between either floodplain or channel grid elements can be simulated as a function of the
   headwater depth, Q = COEFQ*depthEXPQ, where COEFQ and EXPQ are specified coefficients and exponents which are valid for a depth not to exceed HDEPEXC.
   The grid elements containing the structure inlet and outlets must be specified.
   The inlet and outlet grid elements do not have to be contiguous.
   The structure discharge (such as a culvert, weir or bridge) may either inlet or outlet control as long as the discharge is specified as power function
   of the headwater depth.

2. When the headwater depth exceeds the specified depth (HDEPEXC) for which the original rating curve relationship is valid, a second replacement
   relationship is invoked.
   These multiple relationships can be used to specify structure blockage or a change in the rating curve.
   For example, if a height of 5 ft corresponds to the top of a culvert for a discharge of up to 300 cfs, then a second rating curve relation- ship for
   flows over a roadway could be based on a flow depths starting at 6 ft above the culvert invert that could correspond to a discharge of greater than
   500 cfs.
   Structure blockage can be simulated by setting the replacement coefficient (RQCOEF) equal to zero.

3. If a hydraulic structure rating table is used, a linear interpolation between two headwater depths in the rating table is applied to estimate the
   discharge for a headwater depth computed by the model.

4. The rating table should always have the first pair of depth-discharge data as headwater depth = 0 and discharge = 0 to enable interpolation with the
   next data pair in the rating table.

5. The hydraulic structure may be any type of flow control such as a bridge, diversion, culvert, weir, road- way or spillway.
   If a short culvert is simulated that is separated by more than one grid element, neither the travel time or volume of storage in the culvert is
   considered.
   The discharge is computed at the outflow element for the same timestep.
   This is a relatively minor assumption that should not affect the simulation unless the culvert can contain a significant portion of the flood volume
   in the entire model.

6. If the culvert is long (CLENGTH > 500 ft or 154 m), Muskingum-Cunge volume routing is applied.
   The flow area for the culvert is required as given by the variables COEFA, EXPA, RACOEF, RAEXP and ATABLE.
   The model will automatically substitute use the long culvert volume routing when CLENGTH > 1.

7. If the hydraulic structure is a bridge, culvert or weir between two floodplain elements, set IFPORCHAN = 0.
   If the structure in a channel, set IFPORCHAN = 1.
   If the structure such as a culvert or pump collects discharge from a floodplain and discharges to a channel, set IFPORCHAN =
2. Finally is the hydraulic structure has an inlet in a channel element and an outlet in a floodplain element, IFPORCHAN =3.

8. The Department of Transportation generalized culvert equations can be used to assess inlet and outlet control.
   The type of culvert entrances are:.

BOX entrance:

type 1 - wingwall flare 30 to 75 degrees

type 2 - wingwall flare 90 or 15 degrees type 3 - wingwall flare 0 degrees

PIPE entrance:

type 1 - square edge with headwall type 2 - socket end with headwall type 3 - socket end projecting

9. The culvert equations use the conventional entrance loss coefficients KE values that be found in the literature.

10.
If INOUTCONT(I,J) = 0, then the hydraulic structure discharge is based solely on the upstream water surface elevation ( headwater depth above the
reference elevation which is either assigned or represents the node elevation).
This is equivalent to inlet control for a culvert.
If INOUTCONT(I,J) = 1, then the tailwater submergence is evaluated.
As the tailwater elevation approaches the upstream headwater elevation, the model adjusts the rating curve or table and gradually reduces the
discharge as the outlet becomes submerged.
When the switch INOUTCONT(I,J) = 2, submergence discharge reduction occurs and if the tailwater elevation exceeds the headwater elevation then flow
upstream is possible.
When the hydraulic structure discharge is greater than the upstream inflow, the headwater elevation decreases and the tailwater elevation increases.
As the two water surface elevations on each side of the structure equilibrate, the submergence factor reduces the structure discharge.
This may occur because of tailwater effects or because the structure discharge rating table was overestimated for the upstream flow conditions.
The submergence modifications to the rating table are reported in the REVISED_RATING_TABLES.OUT file.

11.
By assigning ISTORMDOUT, the discharge from this outflow element will represent the collective inflow from any number of upstream inflow elements with
the same outflow node.
The discharge in the outflow element ISTORMDOUT can be limited to the maximum discharge value STORMDMAXQ.
When the STORMDMAXQ is exceeded, no additional inflow discharge will be computed for successive downstream inflow nodes.
This simplified storm drain routine does not include any pipe flow routing and does not use the storm drain component.
The purpose of this component is to estimate the collected discharge in a large series of culverts or a limited storm drain net-

work.
It will limit the potential inflow as the pipe capacity is reached without performing a pipe network discharge calculation.
For complex pipe networks, use the FLO-2D storm drain model.

12.
CDIAMETER is primarily used to estimate the timing of flow through a long culvert.
This is accomplished with a Muskingum-Cunge method of storage routing.
When the culvert is longer than about 300 ft (100 m), the timing of the flow in the culvert may not match the timing of the floodwave progression.
Generally, the amount of storage in the culvert is not significant compared to the flood volume.
Use CDIAMETER for a box culvert width if the generalized culvert equations are used.
When using other culvert shapes such as an oval, define an approximate equivalent circular culvert diameter.
For multiple box culverts, define an equivalent single box culvert width (CUBASE) and height (CDIAMETER).

13.
A hydraulic structure can be set up to compute flow exchange from a channel element to a floodplain node.
For example, a channel may share flow through a weir structure to a retention basin represented by floodplain elements.

14.
For hydraulic structures simulation of pumps, set the intake elevation as the Head Reference Elevation.
The default value is zero.
This setting will use the grid element elevation of the inlet node intake elevation for the pump.
That may be incorrect and result in a negative head on the intake.

15.
For generalized culverts, the INOUTCONT should be set to 0, 1, or 2.
The tailwater conditions submergence and reversed flow direction will be allowed based on the switch position.
1 allows submergence and 2 allows flow in the upstream direction.

16.
The bridge hydraulic routine replaces the need for rating curves or rating tables and represents significant added detail in computing free surface
flow, pressure flow or combined pressure and weir discharge for flow over the deck.
See the White Paper “Bridge Hydraulics Component” for the details on the bridge flow routine that is available in the FLO-2D Help folder.

17.
In the bridge hydraulics component, the free surface flow is computed using various coefficients that represent the bridge features impact on the flow
as a function of water surface elevation (such as piers).
The user can assign the coefficients directly or use the automated interpolation of the USGS coefficients from the White Paper Appendix figures.

18.
Bridge pressure flow is computed as either sluice gate flow or orifice flow de- pending on the water surface elevation with respect to the bridge
soffit.

19.
When the water surface exceeds the bridge deck elevation, broadcrested weir flow is computed.
This is added to the pressure flow to determine the total discharge through the bridge.
It is recommended that the weir coefficient be

estimated on the low side to account for spaced rails, walkways, debris and other non-uniform deck features.

20.
If simulating culvert discharge using the generalized culvert equations with multiple barrels or openings, input the geometry of a single barrel or
opening and the MULTBARRELS parameter at the end of line F.
It is assumed that each culvert barrel has identical geometry and invert elevation.
If using only one barrel, this variable is not added.

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

Instructional Comments for the SUBMERGE_FACTOR.DAT FILE

1. When the tailwater water approaches the headwater surface elevation and the

headwater depth/tailwater depth approaches 1, then the submergence factor is change is

HSUBFACTOR = HSUBFACTOR - 0.01 \* SUBM_ADJ

or

HSUBFACTOR = HSUBFACTOR + 0.015 \* SUBM_ADJ

2. The submergence factor for hydraulic structures is not a DOT table but rather it adjusts on the fly during runtime.
   This is not new.
   What is new is SUBM\_ ADJ.
   If SUBM_ADJ = 1.0, there is no change from the existing method.
   If a SUBMERGE_FACTOR only has

1811 1.0

1862 1.0

Then an output file is written: HYDRAULIC STRUCTURE SUBFACTORS.
OUT with only the listed cells and subfactor data including discharge but no subfactor acceleration.
This gives the user the following choices:

1. No changes at all without the SUBMERGE_FACTOR.DAT file.
   Every- thing is exactly the way it is now.

2. Write out the subfactor changes for only the specified cells in the data file.
   No acceleration if SUBM_ADJ = 1.0.

3. Write out the subfactor changes and use the acceleration to increase the rate of change in the subfactor SUBM_ADJ > 1.0 or decrease the rate of
   change: SUBM_ADJ < 1.0.

If the grid element contains more than one street, Line 4 must be repeated.
If a given grid element has more than one street in one direction, modify WIDR(K) to represent the combined widths of the streets.
Up to 8 street segments, one for each of the 8 compass directions, can be assigned according to the ISTDIR variable.
By setting WIDR(K) = 0.0, the WIDST global width will be assigned to that street segment (see comments 4 and 5).

WIDST r 0.01 - Global assignment of street width to all streets.
This value is superseded by WIDR(K) when WIDR(K) is greater than zero (see comments 2 and 4).

Instructional Comments for the STREET.DAT FILE

1. The street name is provided for the user to separate the streets groups for easy

identification in the data file.
It is not used in the program.

2. The street depth, width and n-values can be assigned globally for all the street elements.
   The street depth, width, n-value and elevation can be spatially variable for the individual grid elements.

3. If the street elevation is different from the representative grid elevation assigned in the FPLAIN.DAT file, it should be specified in line 3,
   otherwise the street elevation will be the floodplain elevation minus the curb height.
   This elevation is then used to determine the street slope.

4. The street width should be less than the width of the grid element.
   The over-all floodplain surface area of the grid after the streets are removed must be at least 5% of the original surface area (grid element width
   squared).
   If there are numerous streets in the grid element that occupy all the grid element surface area, consider leaving out the smaller less significant
   streets, reduce the street width or transfer one or more streets segments to a neighboring grid element.
   An- other option is to increase the grid element size and reassign the grid system.

5. The street is assumed to extend from the center of the grid element to the grid element boundary in the four compass directions plus the four diagonal
   directions as specified by the variable ISTDIR(K).
   A street that crosses the entire grid element is assigned two street sections and directions in Line 4.

6. Each grid element should be listed only once in the STREET.DAT file.
   For street intersections within the grid element, list all the street flow directions for the first street, then skip that grid element for the
   succeeding crossing streets.

7. The street flow depth tolerance value TOLST below which no street flow routing computations are performed is 0.03 ft or 0.01 meters.
   This value is replacing the floodplain tolerance TOL value in TOLER.DAT and it is hardwired into the model.
   The user cannot adjust it.

Assuming that the flow field is oriented with the north direction, use the following WRF assignment:

WRF(I,1) = North WRF(I,2) = East WRF(I,3) = South WRF(I,4) = West

WRF(I,5) = Northeast WRF(I,6) = Southeast WRF(I,7) = Southwest WRF(I,8) = Northwest

where I is the grid element number (see comment 2).

Instructional Comments for the ARF.DAT File

1. For a partially blocked grid element, those ARF and WRF values that are 0.0 must be entered.
   The graphical assignment and editing of ARF and WRF values are relatively easy with the FLO-2D Plugin.
   See tutorials for instructions.

2. Each grid element can receive or discharge flow through eight sides.
   Consider each element to be an octagon.
   Each WRF factor refers to the percent blockage of one of the eight sides.
   If blockage redundancy is written to ARF.DAT, the model will use the more restrictive WRF value.

3. The maximum ARF value is dependent on the grid element size unless the grid element is totally blocked out in Line 1 as a ITTAWF grid element.
   This ensures that at least 5% of the grid element is left for flow storage.
   ARF values will be adjusted to prevent numerical instability.
   The following table lists the adjustment triggers.

TABLE 4.2.
ARF VALUES TRIGGER MAX

Grid Element Size Maximum ARF Reset to 1

Cell Side > 50 0.95

20 < to < 50 0.90

20 > Cell Side 0.85

4. Instead of completely blocking any flow from entering the ITTAWF elements, assigning ARFBLOCKMOD < 1.
   will allow some flow storage in these completely blocked elements.
   This variable only modifies totally blocked elements.

5. To assess the potential for building collapse, assign the totally blocked element (-ITTAWF) or the partially blocked ARF value (-ARF) in ARF.DAT as a
   negative value.
   Each building element that could collapse must be assigned a negative value.
   If a building consists of multiple totally blocked elements (ITTAWF

~ T-line in ARF.DAT), all of the ITTAWF grid element numbers must be assigned as negative to completely remove the building.

Instructional Comments for the MULT.DAT File

1. If a grid element is assigned multiple channels and, in addition, contains a main

channel or buildings such that the available floodplain surface storage area is less than 50% of the original grid element surface area, then the
model will reset that grid element to overland sheet flow (i.e.
no multiple channels).
The program will automatically eliminate any multiple channels in grid elements with streets.
The available surface area and the assigned variable can be reviewed in the SURFAREA.OUT output file.

2. If a multiple channel fills and is about to overflow, it is assumed that it is an alluvial channel and will widen to accept more flow.
   Thus when the flow depth exceeds the maximum channel depth DM, the model increases the width by WMC to maintain the channel conveyance.
   The multiple channel will not overflow on the floodplain, but will continue to widen until the gully is wider than the grid element.
   The flood routing will then revert to overland flow in that element.
   The following rules govern the assignment of the multiple channel data:

· When the flow depth exceeds the multiple channel (gully) depth, the flow width of the gully is increased by the incremental width.

· If it is desired to force the flow to stay in a channel of fixed width, set the incremental width equal to zero.

· If the number of multiple channels assigned in a grid element is set equal to zero, overland sheet flow without multiple channels is assumed.

· The spatially variable grid element data will supersede the global data.

3. If it is desired to force the flow to stay in a channel of fixed width, set the variable WMC = 0.

4. The total flow width is determined by multiplying the number of channels in each grid element by the corresponding width.

5. SSLOPEMIN and SSLOPEMAX define a range of watershed slope in which the multiple channel width will be expanded.
   This will limit the channel width growth to the middle portion of the basin and will not expand the other mul- tiple channels.
   By expanding the channels for increased conveyance capacity, the time of concentration can be reduced.
   The default SSLOPEMIN = SS- LOPEMAX = 0.0 will result in width increases for all multiple channels.

6. The avulsion component will be initiated if AVULD50 > 0.
   When a multiple channel conveyance capacity is exceeded in a given grid element, the model will search the other flow direction neighbor elements
   without a multiple channel

and will create a multiple channel in that grid element based on width and depth relationship as a function of bed material size (AVULD50).
This will continue in the downslope direction until the multiple channel conveyance capacity is no longer exceeded.
For more information, see the avulsion discussion white paper in the FLO-2D Handouts and Reference Manual.

Instructional Comments for the SIMPLE_MULT.DAT File

1. Similar to the conventional multiple channel option, the simplified multiple channel switch IMULTC is set to 1 for the component to be activated.
   Again, IMULTC is the fifth parameter in line 2 of the CONT.DAT file.

2. Flow is simulated in a small rectangular channel with an initial width of 2 ft and depth of 1 foot.

3. If the flow depth exceeds the 1 ft deep rill channel, then the channel width is expanded by 2 times the initial width of 2 ft.
   The maximum allowed channel width is 4 ft.

4. When the maximum width of 4 ft is achieved and the flow depth exceeds the maximum channel depth, the volume greater than the channel depth is
   distributed back to the floodplain surface.

5. The channel bed elevation is 1 ft lower than the grid element elevation

6. If there is no surface area because of the area reduction value (ARF value) assignment, the multiple channel routine is turned off for that grid
   element.

7. If the surface area of the grid element after removing the rill channel surface area is less than 30% of the original grid element surface area, the
   multiple channel routine is turned off for that grid element and the overland flow reverts to sheet flow.

8. The maximum number of multiple channels within the grid element is one.

9. The shallow n-value for the rill channel is 0.100.

10.
A single global n-value can be user specified to represent the rill channels.

11.
The original multiple channel routine can be combined with the simplified component by simply created both multiple channel data files (MULT.DAT and
SIMPLE_MULT.DAT).

12.
MULT.DAT and the SIMPLE_MULT.DAT files contain the multiple channel data.
They can be used together in the same project but for a different group of cells.
They both use the same variable data, but SIMPLE_MULT depth and width are hardwired.

surface area times the percent size distribution.
The default bed thickness is 10 ft (3 m) for the floodplain if bed thickness is less than 0.1 ft.
If there is no available sediment volume for a given size fraction, no further scour of the bed will occur for that sediment size fraction (see
comment 2).

Qw is the water discharge (cfs or cms)

Qs is the sediment supply (tons/day or kg/day).

it is used to identify the sediment transport equation for a specific channel segment or reach (comment 5).
This value supersedes ISEDEQG in Line 2.
In Line 3 (Line ‘Z’), ISEDEQ will set the sediment transport equation for sediment routing by size fractions with a sediment transport equation
assigned to each group.
If Line 3 and the following Line 4’s constitute only one group, then all sediment routing on the floodplain, in the channel and in the streets will
use the same sediment size distribution.
If there is more than one group of Line 3 and the following Line 4’s, then the first group will define the sediment size distribution for the
floodplain, streets and any channel segments where ISEDN = 1 in CHAN.DAT.
Successive channel segments can identify another set of sediment size fractions by setting ISEDN = 2 or higher.
This will permit the channel bed material to vary throughout the river system.

The percent- age represents the percent of the bed material sediment that is finer than the representative size diameter.
For example, SEDPERCENT = 0.456 defines that 45.6% of the sediment is finer than the 1 mm sediment size fraction.
The last entry should be 1.00 (100% of the sediment is smaller than the corresponding sediment diameter).

If a value of XKX is entered, it will be used by the model.
If XKX = 0, then XKX is computed by the following formulas where FPN is the floodplain grid element Manning’s n-value:

FPN < 0.01 XKX = 24

Instructional Comments for the SED.DAT File

1. Armouring is simulated for bed material sizes with a D90 > 16 mm.
   If D90 > 16 mm, then an armor exchange layer with a thickness (3 x D90) is established.
   Initially the exchange layer has the same sediment size distribution as prescribed for the bed.
   The volume and size distribution of each sediment size fraction in the exchange layer is tracked on a timestep basis independent of the remaining bed
   material size.
   A potential armor sediment size D84 is predicted for the prescribed bed material size (see the armor discussion in chapter 4 of the FLO- 2D Reference
   Manual).
   If the computed D84 grain size equals or exceeds the predicted D84 armor size then an armor layer is assumed that will protect the smaller size
   sediment in bed from scour.

2. While the bed thickness can be used to limit scour in the channel, it is suggested that a reasonable bed thickness be initially specified to determine
   if the channel computes an unreasonable scour depth.

3. To select an appropriate sediment routing equation, refer to chapter 4 of the FLO-2D Reference Manual.
   If uncertain as to which equation may be best suited to the project, Zeller and Fullerton or Yang’s equation will predict a moderate sediment
   transport capacity for a wide range of field conditions.

4. Mudflow simulation is dependent on the appropriate selection of viscosity and yield stress parameters.
   Please review the mudflow discussion in Chapter 4 of the FLO-2D Reference Manual to determine an appropriate viscosity and yield stress relationship
   as function of sediment concentration.
   There are also mud- flow guidelines available in the Handout documents.
   Viscosity and yield stress units are defined in Table 2.1.

5. The floodplain spatially variable sediment size fraction is assigned by sediment groups (Lines 3, 4 and 10).
   Line 10 (G) relates the cell number to the sediment group.
   Spatial variation can be assigned to the channel by segments using the ISEDN parameter in the CHAN.DAT file.
   ISEDN is used to identify the sediment group for each segment.
   If there are two sediment groups as shown in the above example data file, there could be one floodplain sediment size distribution and one channel
   size distribution or there could be two channel segment size distributions by using the first sediment group to represent one of the channel segments
   as specified by the ISEDN variable in CHAN.DAT.

6. It is important to note that each sediment group will have the identical size fraction delineation.
   The SEDIAM variable will be the same for all the groups (i.e.
   the number of Line 4s in all groups will be the same).
   If one group is missing a specific size fraction, then the sediment percentage for that group

(SEDPERCENT variable) will either be the same as the previous value or only slightly different (see the above example data file).

7. The debris basin volume is assigned to an inflow node.
   The inflow node will not compute discharge to downstream cells until the basin volume is exceeded.

Instructional Comments for the LEVEE.DAT File

1. The prescribed levee failure criteria are as follows:

a. For the levee to fail when overtopped by the flow, set FAILELEV and FAILTIME = 0.

b. To fail the levee at a specified elevation, set FAILELEV equal to the failure elevation.

c. To fail the levee at a specified level below the top of the levee, set FAILELEV to a value less than 10 ft and the levee will fail at an elevation
   equal to LEVCREST - FAILELEV.

d. To fail the levee at a specific level below the crest after the water surface reaches FAILELEV for a cumulative duration, assign FAILTIME.

e. To fail the levee to a new base elevation that is different than the floodplain elevation, assign LEVBASE.

f. To fail a levee to a specified maximum width, set the FAILWIDTHMAX to the limiting width.

g. To simulate instantaneous collapse, set the FAILRATE and FAILWIDRATE to zero (see Comment 10).

h. Progressive levee failure is simulated by assigning a value to FAILRATE (ft/hr).
   This computes the new levee crest elevation as failure proceeds.
   FAILRATE is a vertical rate of decrease in the levee breach elevation.

i. If prescribed failure levee grid element is negative, the failure data for that element is assumed to be global and applies to all the levee elements
   and blocked flow directions.
   In this case, the failure data needs only to be assigned to one element.

2. No multiple channels will be assigned to grid elements with levees.
   Multiple channels in a levee grid element are eliminated automatically by the model.

3. Each levee grid element can have up to eight failure directions.
   The initial breach width is hardwired as 1.0 ft (0.3 m).
   The user specifies the maximum anticipated breach width with the parameter FAILWIDTHMAX.
   If the maxi- mum failure width is greater than the grid element side width, the breach will extend into adjacent grid elements until the maximum
   failure width is reached or the levee ends.

4. Flow over a levee is computed as broadcrested weir flow using a coefficient of

3.09 until the tailwater depth is 80% of the headwater depth.
The discharge computation then reverts to overland flow based on the water surface elevations on each side of the levee and the flow depth over the
levee.

5. Levee freeboard deficit is reported in the output file LEVEEDEFIC.OUT.
   Five levels of freeboard deficit are listed in the file as follows:

Level 0 > 3 ft

1 2 ft < freeboard < 3 ft

2 1 ft < freeboard < 2 ft

3 freeboard < 1 ft

4 levee overtopped

6. There two options for specifying levee or dam breach failure.
   Set ILEVFAIL = 1 to assess the breach failure with prescribed rates of breach opening vertically and horizontally.
   Set ILEVFAIL = 2 to allow the model to simulate the breach erosion failure.

7. Guidelines on levee failure can be found in the Handouts folder: C:\\ users\\ public\\public documents\\FLO-2D PRO Documentation\\flo_help\\Handouts\\
   FLO-2D Levee, Dam, and Wall Failure Guidelines.pdf.

8. A report of the levee overtop discharge results are written to the LEVEEOVER- TOP.OUT file for any element that is listed with a negative grid element
   number in the LEVEE.DAT file.

9. A distinction has been made for the start times of the Time to 1 ft and Time to 2 ft and Time to Peak for levee and dam breach models.
   Two start times are now available.
   The default start time initiates when the model starts.
   The alternate start time initiates when the levee or dam breach begins.
   This is complicated if there are multiple levee or dam breaches.
   It should also be noted that inflow hydrographs or rainfall may not sync with a breach.
   There can only be one start time.
   Distinguishing flows mixing from breaches, flood hydrographs, rainfall is impossible.

10.
Wall failure procedures are defined in the guidelines listed above.
The procedures for setting up walls and wall failure, wall failure and grid element elevations, walls and ARFs, and the automatic controls applied by
the FLO-2D engine are all explained in the guidelines.
A wall failure tutorial is available online in the Self-Help Kit at https://documentation.flo-2.com/html.

11.
Levee failure criteria:

· Water surface elevation must be greater than the prescribed levee failure elevation plus a tolerance value of 0.1 ft or 0.03 m.

· Water surface elevation on the reservoir side of the levee must be higher than the downstream water surface elevation.

· The water surface elevation minus the ground elevation (flow deopth) on the reservoir side must be greater than the water surface elevation minus
the ground elevation (flow depth) on the downstream side of the dam or levee.

IFLO is set to one of the following:

1 flow to the north 5 flow to the northeast

2 flow to the east 6 flow to the southeast

3 flow to the south 7 flow to the southwest

4 flow to the west 8 flow to the northwest

If the output is desired from only one direction (i.e.
without the discharge components from the other component flow directions), set IFLO as negative.
IFLO is set to the following:

-1 flow from south only -5 flow from southwest only

-2 flow from west only -6 flow from northwest only

-3 flow from north only -7 flow from northeast only

-4 flow from east only -8 flow from southeast only

NODX(N,J) i 1 - NNOD Array of grid elements that constitute a given floodplain cross section (see comment 2 and 3).

NNXSEC(N)

i

1 - 1,000 Number of floodplain elements in a given cross section.
The selected cross section grid elements do not have to extend across the entire grid system.
Only one grid element is necessary to constitute a floodplain cross section.
The cross section can include a channel element.
If one of the floodplain cross section grid elements is a channel element, the cross-section discharge hydrograph reported in HYCROSS will include the
channel element dis- charge.

Instructional Comments for the FPXSEC.DAT File

1. The floodplain grid elements can be combined to define a cross section across

a floodplain or alluvial fan.
Each floodplain cross section is assigned flow dis- charge in only one flow direction given by IFLO.
This direction includes the flow contribution from the two contiguous directions.
The cross section routine can be used to isolate the results for a single element.
The flow directions and associated discharge components are as follows:

TABLE 4.3.
CROSS SECTION FLOW DIRECTION

Selected Cross Section Flow Direction Flow Direction Components added to the Cross Section Discharge

north = 1 northeast 5 and northwest 8

east = 2 northeast 5 and southeast 6

south = 3 southeast 6 and southwest 7

west = 4 southwest 7 and northwest 8

northeast = 5 north 1 and east 2

southeast = 6 east 2 and south 3

southwest = 7 south 3 and west 4

northwest = 8 west 4 and north 1

For the diagonal flow directions (5 thru 8), the discharge for the grid element between the two diagonal corners will be added to the cross-section
total dis- charge for the selected flow direction.

2. If a grid element is listed more than once, the simulation will fail and the ER- ROR.CHK file will report the redundant element.

3. The floodplain cross section grid elements can be selected graphically with the FLO-2D Plugin.
   See FLO-2D Plugin User Manual for instructions.

4. Select a flow direction perpendicular to the cross section only.
   For example, if the cross-section orientation is East to West, the flow direction should be North or South only.

r

0.1 - 10 Slope of the upstream face of the levee or dam for a prescribed grid element failure location.
ZU is expressed as a ratio (horizontal : vertical).
For ex- ample: ZU = 2.0 represents 2.0 horizontal to 1.0 vertical.

Instructional Comments for the BREACH.DAT File

1. There is a choice of either identifying a global or local levee breach location.
   If the breach location is assigned locally, it is necessary to provide only the Local (D-Lines) 5-8 in the BREACH.DAT file.
   This data is entered in the Individual tab of the FLO-2D Plugin Breach dialog box.
   If the model locates all the potential breach locations based on the water surface elevation, then it is only necessary to assign the global
   parameters (G-Lines) in lines 1-4 and the vari- able GBRBOTTOMEL = vertical distance (ft or m) below the levee or dam crest elevation.
   If the water surface elevation exceeds GBRBOTTOMEL, then a levee piping failure will be initiated.
   One or more breach locations can be prescribed and still permit the model to determine any other potential breach locations to be initiated by setting
   GBBOTTOMEL to value less than about 10 ft (3 m) below the crest elevation.

2. Initial breach width to depth ratio (BRATIO) – if the assigned breach width to depth ration is 0., then BRATIO = 2.

3. The initial piping width and depth is assumed to be 0.5 ft (0.15 m).

4. The minimum and maximum Manning’s n-value permitted for the breach flow resistance are 0.02 and 0.25, respectively.

5. The downstream pipe outlet at the toe of the dam or levee is hard coded to the grid element floodplain elevation plus 1 ft (0.3 m).

6. Breach discharge is computed if the upstream water surface elevation exceeds the upstream breach pipe or channel bottom elevation plus the tolerance
   value (TOL ~ 0.1 ft or 0.3 m).

7. The levee fragility curve ID is only one letter (e.g. S) and a number (e.g. 3) and the data line begins with ID character ‘F’.
   The levee fragility curve assignment to the levee grid element is assigned in the LEVEE.DAT file.

8. If Line 2 begins with G1, a global breach simulation is initiated to locate the potential breach based on the water surface elevation.
   If Line 2 has a B2 identifier, then a prescribed breach location will be simulated as defined by the breach element and flow direction in Line B2
   (global breach data is not required)

Instructional Comments for the FPFROUDE.DAT File

1. The spatially variable limiting Froude number supersedes the global limiting Froude number (FROUDL) in CONT.DAT.

2. When FROUDEFP is exceeded the grid element roughness value will be increased by 0.001 for the next timestep.
   After a flood simulation, review ROUGH.OUT to determine where FROUDEFP was exceeded and the maxi- mum n-values for that cell were computed.
   Consider revising the n-values in the MANNINGS_N.DAT file to match those in the ROUGH.OUT file.
   This will ensure that FROUDEFP is not exceeded.
   Rename the MANNINGS_N.

Instructional Comments for the SWMMFLO.DAT File

1. The Storm Drain Guidelines manual offers a comprehensive overview of storm drain modeling using FLO-2D.
   The storm drain feature names must begin with an i or I to indicate an inlet, im or IM to indicate a manhole.
   This naming convention will allow the FLO-2D Plugin and FLOPRO.EXE to identify features that will connect to the surface for flow exchange.
   The storm drain naming feature need not be overly complicated because locating the features is simple with the various attribute query tools available
   in QGIS.
   A simple convention is to name inlets, junctions, outfalls and conduits so that they are easily sorted.
   For example.
   i or I for inlets, im or IM for manholes, j or J for junctions, o or O for outfalls.

2. The SWMMFLO.DAT file is automatically generated by FLO-2D PluginS using the SWMM.inp file data to locate the inlet position and transfer it to the
   FLO-2D grid system.
   For an extensive discussion and guidelines, refer to the Storm Drain Manual.
   There are three storm drain inlet options:

1) Curb opening inlet at grade (Type 1)

2) Curb opening inlet depressed or sag (Type 2)

3) Grate or grate with gutter inlet (at grade or depressed - Type 3)

4) Non-typical inlet e.g. headwall (Type 4)

5) Manhole with cover (Type 5) The storm drain inlet data requirements are:

Type 1 - Curb opening inlet at grade

Weir coefficient: 2.85 - 3.30 (suggested 3.00 English, 1.6 Metric) Curb opening length

Curb opening height

Type 2 - Curb opening inlet with sag Weir coefficient: 2.30 (1.25 metric) Curb opening length

Curb opening height Curb opening sag width

Type 3 - Grate (or grate with gutter) inlet with/without sag

Weir coefficient: 2.85 - 3.30 (suggested 3.00 English, 1.6 metric) Grate perimeter (not including curb side)

Grate open area

Grate sag height (zero for at grade)

Type 4 - Variable storm drain inlet geometry.

Weir coefficient: not required.

The storm drain inlet rating table (line n with depth and discharge pairs) is required in the SWMMFLORT data file.

Type 5 - Manhole.

Weir coefficient: 2.85 - 3.20 Manhole perimeter

Manhole flow area Surcharge depth

Note: Orifice flow coefficient = 0.67 (hardwired) for all cases.

3. The Feature switch = 0 allows a type 4 inlet to be horizontal.
   This means the inlet exchanges flow with the grid element at the rim elevation.
   It is best ap- plied to headwall features that are submerged below the surface of the grid.
   The Feature switch = 1 if the type 4 inlet is vertical.
   This means the inlet exchanges water with the grid element at the invert elevation.
   This feature type is used when an inlet is a headwall.
   The max depth of this type of structure is the conduit height.
   The feature switch can also be used as a flap gate.
   In some cases a storm drain node needs to have the data of an inlet but also act as an outfall.
   The feature switch allows a flap gate to be applied if flow is controlled and not allowed to return to the surface as return flow.

4. The feature switch = 3 will allow the storm drain engine to always try and feed water to the storm drain system even when the drop box is at capacity.

IGRID(I) i 1 - NNOD Nodes selected to assign spatially variable shallow
n.

SHALLOWN(I) r 0.01 - 0.99 Spatially variable shallow n-value (see comment 1)

Instructional Comments for the SHALLOWN_SPATIAL File

1. To improve the timing of the floodwave progression through the grid system, a depth variable roughness can be assigned.
   The basic equation for the grid element roughness nd as function of flow depth is:

nd = nb \*1.5 \* e -(0.4 depth/dmax)

where:

nb = bankfull discharge roughness depth = flow depth

dmax = flow depth for drowning the roughness elements and vegetation (hardwired 3 ft or 1 m)

This equation prescribes that the variable depth floodplain roughness is equal to the assigned flow roughness for complete submergence of all
roughness elements (assumed to be 3 ft or 1 m).
This equation is applied by the model as a default and the user can turn ‘off’ the depth roughness adjustment coefficient for all grid elements by
assigning AMANN = -99.
This roughness adjustment will slow the progression of the floodwave.
It is valid for flow depths ranging from 0.5 ft (0.15 m) to 3 ft (1 m).
For example, at 1 ft (0.3 m), the computed roughness will be about 1.31 times the assigned roughness for a flow depth of 3 ft.
Assigning a ROUGHADJ value may reduce unexpected high Froude numbers.

The following rules apply:

If the

0.0 < flow depth < 0.2 ft (0.06 m) n = SHALLOWN value

0.2 ft (0.06 m) < flow depth < 0.5 ft (0.15 m) n = SHALLOWN/2.

0.5 ft (0.15 m) < flow depth < 3 ft (1 m) n = nb \*1.5 \* e-(0.4 depth/dmax)

3 ft (1 m) < flow depth n = n-value in MANNINGS_N.DAT

See comment 3.

XNSTR(K) r 0.01 - 0.5 Street n-values for individual gutter elements.
Supersedes STREET_n-value.

Instructional Comments for the GUTTER File

1. The gutter elements are street elements defined by the floodplain (not street component) where the flow in the street will be based on the gutter
   height and a hard coded 2% cross slope in the street (triangular flow area).
   This concentrates the flow against the gutter and results in deeper flow depth and higher velocities for floodwave movement.
   The discharge in the gutter flow area defined by the GUTTER.DAT file parameters is routed between gutter elements.
   This gutter routing algorithm is not the storm drain curb height option that only increases the head on the storm drain inlet.
   For the curb height option, the flow is still routed as a rectangular flow overland flow between street grid elements.

· The gutter is assigned to one of the 8 sides of the gutter element.
The following rules govern the flow exchange of gutter street element with the other elements when the flow depth in the gutter element exceeds the
tolerance value (TOL):

· The flow is exchanged with a contiguous gutter element based on the flow depth against the curb.

· The flow is shared with a street element without a gutter based on the average depth between the two contiguous elements.

· The flow is shared with a contiguous floodplain element that is not a street and is not a curb flow direction based on the average flow depth
between the two contiguous elements.

· If the flow direction is the curb direction or one of the two diagonal directions associated with the curb direction, the flow is first ex- changed
to the sidewalk area within the gutter element when the flow depth exceeds the curb height.
This exchange occurs in either direction from the street to the sidewalk or from the sidewalk to the street.
After the internal flow exchange within the gutter element is complete the overland flow between the sidewalk area and the contiguous floodplain
element in the curb direction is exchanged based on the average flow depth between the two grid elements.

2. If the street width (WIDSTR) exceeds the grid element width, then the street width is limited to 0.90 times the grid element width to allow for the
   sidewalk surface area.

3. The flow exchange between the gutter street elements is based on the Dept.
   of Transportation gutter flow modification to account for the larger hydraulic radius.
   This essentially increases the steady uniform n-value for open prismatic flow by about 5.3 times.

4. The spatially variable or individual element assigned street width, curb height and n-value supersede the global values.

1. During a flood event or a mud/debris flow, it is possible that a building could collapse and be removed.
   To predict the collapse of a building during flooding vulnerability curves are applied.
   The three vulnerability curves are poor or highly susceptible to flood collapse (mobile homes), moderate for buildings with foundations, and good for
   building with more substantial construction.
   A fourth curve developed by Clausen and Clark in 1990 is also available.

FILE: TAILINGS_CV.DAT

TAILINGS DATA

Variable Descriptions for the TAILINGS_CV.DAT File

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

Instructional Comments for the TAILINGS_CV.DAT File

1. TAILINGS_CV.DAT data file assigns flow depths and sediment concentrations to each FLO-2D grid cell within the tailing dam.
   For the first computation timestep, flow depths and tailings surface elevations are used to compute a surface slope to initiate motion.
   The tailings dam material begins to move as a mudflow.
   There is no water storage, so there is no two-phase flow.

2. The flow depth volume (in the TAILINGS_CV.DAT file) is summed up and reported as INFLOW volume in the SUMMARY.OUT file.
   This can be com- pared to the known or estimated tailings dam volume.
   It is contingent upon the user to either assess the depth of the tailings by grid element or knowing the tailings surface elevation and pre-dam
   topography to compute the tailings depth as the difference between two surfaces in CAD or GIS.

3. If storage volume vs stage data is available, this would allow the user to check the volume associated with the depths in the TAILINGS_CV.DAT file.
   The user should not use the project volume vs stage data because this makes all the volume available at the toe of the dam and there is no routing of
   the mud- flow through the dam breach.
   Only a portion of the tailings will actually flow through the breach.

Instructional Comments for the TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.DAT File

1. TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.DAT is used to simulate a static or seismic tailings dam failure where the tailings constitute the dam.
   This file will contain the tailing grid elements, water depth on the surface of the tailings and tailings depth.
   If the tailings stack failure is only mudflow and not 2 phase flow, then only the tailings depth will be listed in this file.
   This file can be imported to QGIS or opened in an ASCII file program editor (WordPad) to revise or con- tour the tailings depths and this will now
   constitute the FLO-2D simulation source volume.

2. The TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.DAT file can be created using a preparation FLO-2D model simulation in the following sequence:

i. Create the tailings dam using the LEVEE.DAT to encompass the tailings reservoir area.
   The grid elevation is pre-dam construction.

ii.
Assign the tailings stack depth using the R-line of INFLOW.DAT file to assign the tailings elevation.

iii.
Set the simulation time SIMUL = 0.001 hr.
and the output interval TOUT = 0.001 hr in CONT.DAT.

iv.
Run the FLO-2D model to generate the TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.
DAT file.

v. Rename the INFLOW.DAT to INFLOW1.DAT or some other name.

vi.
Either turn the LEVEE switch off in CONT.DAT or select those levee crest elements for removal using QGIS.

vii.
Assign SIMUL = simulation model time with a representative TOUT =

0.1 or some other value.

viii.
viii.
Run the FLO-2D model again and the assigned stack depths will begin to move at the initiation of the model.

3. A second option is to assign the TAILINGS_STACK_DEPTH.DAT in QGIS and then follow steps vi thru viii above to initiate the stack failure.

Instructional Comments for the LID_VOLUME.DAT File

1. Assign a storage volume to a grid element(s) that must be filled before sharing with other grid elements as overland flow.
   The storage can represent any type of LID facility.
   For example, a group of grid elements can represent a rooftop or building area.
   The assigned LID volume must be filled before the cell can exchange with ground simulating a cistern that collects rainfall runoff.
   Another example is pervious pavers in a driveway or parking lot.

2. The LID volume may be a preferred method over assigning the TOLSPATIAL.
   DAT data to represent a LID storage volume because the flow depth will be not added to the grid element when considering rainfall runoff distribution.

FILE: MULTDOMAIN.DAT

MULTIPLE DOMAIN DATA FILE

Variable Descriptions for the MULTDOMAIN.DAT File

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

Instructional Comments for the MULTDOMAIN.DAT File

1. Downstream cells: it can be only 1 as it is shown in the example, or more than

1. If the downstream cells are more than 1, then the upstream discharge will be divided between the number of downstream cells.

2. Outflow.dat still needs the O1 - O9 lines to create the downstream inflow.

3. No need to copy the CADPTS.DAT from downstream domains to upstream domain to establish connectivity during runtime.

4. The FLOPRO.exe will create the following output file: InflowUps-Dows_DS X.DAT, X is the number of the domain: 1, 2 and 3 for the example above.

5. The output file has the same structure and format of a typical INFLOW.DAT file, where downstream cells specified in the DAT files for each subdomain
   (cells have to be receiving flow) will be written to the downstream cell IN- FLOW data file.
   Downstream cells have to be routing some flow, in other words, if a cell is specified in the DAT file has a flow discharge equal to zero for the
   entire simulation, then the cell will not be written to the output file.

FILE: STEEP_SLOPEN.DAT

STEEP SLOPE N VALUE DATA FILE

Variable Descriptions for the STEEP_SLOPEN.DAT File

(s) Switch (i) = Integer variable (r) = Real variable (c) = Character

Instructional Comments for the STEEP_SLOPEN.DAT File

1. The FLO-2D engine will calculate the water surface slope between two grid elements.
   Each flow direction (1 of 8) is assigned a water surface slope for each computational timestep.
   The slope calculation is performed with or without the steep slope assessment.

2. Determine average flow depth between two contiguous grid elements for each of the 8 flow directions for every cell.
   This computation is already part of the FLO-2D flood routing model.

3. Compute the SHALLOWN n-value and depth integrated n-value according to the existing spatially variable and limiting Froude number routines.
   These internal computations will establish the baseline n-value in the FLO-2D model.

4. Apply the steep slope regression equations 1 through 3 for each assigned cell flow direction.
   The most conservative n-value whether the original baseline n- value or the adjusted steep slope n-value will be applied in the FLO-2D model.
