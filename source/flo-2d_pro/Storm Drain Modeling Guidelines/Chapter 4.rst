Chapter 4: Guidelines Storm Drain Setup
========================================

Guidelines Storm Drain Setup
----------------------------

To build a FLO-2D project with a storm drain, it is important to create a functional surface model first.
This includes the following required components:

- Computational domain

- Grid elevation and roughness

- Boundary conditions

- Channels and culverts

- Wall and buildings

Once the surface model is ready, the storm drain can be added to the system using the FLO-2D Plugin.
For detailed instructions including tutorials and videos, please refer to the FLO-2D Documentation website.
https://documentation.flo-2d.com/index.html.
The Self-Help Kit outlines the process to set up a model and add a storm drain system to it.
Three Storm Drain Lessons and the Coastal Tutorial have storm drain systems.

Specific instructions for creating a storm drain in a FLO-2D urban environment are:

- A storm drain inlet/outfall should not be assigned to a completely blocked cell (ARF = 1); A reasonable amount of surface area should be available for
  the storm drain feature to interact with the surface water.

- Higher roughness values can be assigned to floodplain elements with storm drain features (inlet or outfalls) to represent the storm drain flow
  disturbance around the inlet or outfall.
  This would help surface routing numerical stability.

- Inlet rim elevations should match the floodplain elevation.
  For an inlet rating table, the inlet discharge is zero if the floodplain water surface elevation is less than the inlet rim elevation.

- Levees and walls may isolate a storm drain feature in the model resulting in oscillating storm drain discharge.
  A review of the inlet/outfall location may be required.

- Storm drain features should not be assigned to surface water inflow or outflow elements.
  There is an error message generated for this conflict.

Other specific urban guidelines are listed in Table 19.

Default Parameters
------------------

The following storm drain parameters are automatically hardwired in the FLO-2D storm drain model.
Those values written to the SWMM.inp file are automatically replaced at the beginning of the FLO-2D simulation according to the following:

- Runoff Wet Weather (WET_STEP) and Runoff Dry Weather (DRY_STEP) timesteps.
  These watershed routing parameters are not directly used by the FLO-2D storm drain model.

- Lengthening Step (LENGTHENING_STEP) is set as the routing timestep (ROUTING_STEP) divided by 6.
  This is hardwired in the FLO-2D storm drain code, values from SWMM.inp file will be replaced at the beginning of the FLO-2D simulation.
  This option increases the length of the shorter conduits based on the Courant-Friederick-Levy (CFL) stability criteria.
  The storm drain model bases the new equivalent pipe length on an estimate of the full flow velocity in the conduit as well as on the wave celerity.
  The full area, width and hydraulic radius are unchanged in the modified link, but the length, slope and roughness are altered.

Length Factor = (Wave Celerity + Full Depth Velocity) \* Timestep/ Pipe Length

   For a Length Factor > 1:

   New Roughness = Old Roughness /Length Factor**0.5

   New Slope =  Old Slope Slope/Length Factor**0.5

- The routing model (FLOW_ROUTING) for the FLO-2D storm drain component is set as dynamic wave (DYNWAVE) to account for backwater effects, entrance/exit
  losses, flow reversal or pressurized flow.
  If the FLOW_ROUTING from the SWMM.INP is different than dynamic wave (DYNWAVE), FLO-2D will replace the routing model from the SWMM.INP with the
  dynamic wave (DYNWAVE) option.

- The inertial term (INERTIAL_DAMPING) is set to PARTIAL or dampen (Partial=1).
  The inertial terms in the Saint Venant Equation are reduced for critical flow and ignored for supercritical flow.

- Report Control Actions and Report Input Summary ([Report] CONTROLS and INPUT) are automatically turned on.

- “Start Reporting on” variables (START_DATE and START_TIME) in the SWMM GUI is automatically set as Start Analysis on.
  Both the FLO-2D and the storm drain model will start reporting results at the beginning of the simulation.

- “End Analysis on” variables (END_DATE and END_TIME) in the SWMM GUI are automatically set based on the simulation time entered in FLO-2D (CON.DAT
  file).
  The Storm Drain results (\*.RPT,\*.OUT) are automatically saved when the model simulation runs until completion.
  If the model is stopped before completion, storm drain results are written.

Initial Parameters
------------------

When building the storm drain model, the following data assignments in the SWMM.inp file are recommended:

1. It is recommended to keep the names of the various storm drain components simple, short, and uniform such as I1, I2, I3… for inlets.
   The number of characters should be less than 25.
   Use O = outlets and C = pipe conduits.
   This will simplify the graphics display of the storm drain components and make it easier to differentiate between inlets, manholes, and outlets.

2. The END_TIME for the model duration is automatically assigned so that the END_TIME minus the START_TIME is equal to the simulation time SIMUL in the
   FLO-2D model CONT.DAT file.

3. The ROUTING_STEP is automatically assigned as equal to the FLO-2D Timestep.
   The FLO-2D Timestep is used as the ROUTING_STEP for all conditions including a VARIABLE_STEP equal or different to zero.

Note: The WET_STEP and DRY_STEP values are hardcoded to 1 minute.

4. The REPORT_START_DATE and REPORT_START_TIME are automatically assigned as the start date and time.

5. The storm drain component reporting time (REPORT_STEP) in SWMM.inp file is recommended to be set up as equal to the FLO-2D output interval (TOUT) in
   the CONT.DAT file.
   Results for the surface water and for the storm drain will be reported with the same output timestep.
   REPORT_STEP is a mixture of hours, minutes, and seconds with the format 00:00:00.
   The unit for TOUT is hours.

Integration of a Storm Drain Network into a Complex Urban Model
---------------------------------------------------------------

Integrating a storm drain network into an urban model requires an understanding of how the storm drains will interact with the surface flow.
In the FLO-2D model, the most complex interaction occurs between the storm drain features and the 1-D channel component.
The storm drain system interfaces with channels through inlets and outfalls.
An early identification of storm drain database deficiencies can save time and effort on a project.

Storm Drain Inlet – Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After initial set up of the urban project, the following issues related to the storm drain inlet to channel system should be addressed:

- Inlet locations:

- Inlets must be inside the FLO-2D computational domain;

- Inlets cannot be assigned to the interior channel elements;

- Inlets that pick-up water from the street or overland should not be assigned to the channel left bank elements.

- Inlet elevations:

- Channels discharging to a storm drain inlet should have a invert elevation that matches the inlet invert elevation;

- In most instances, the inlet should be set up as a vertical inlet in the SWMMFLO.DAT file using the Feature switch.

Storm drain inlets should not be assigned to an interior channel element.
If a channel discharges directly to a storm drain conduit inlet, like a culvert inlet, assign the inlet to the channel left bank element.
For this configuration, a vertical Type 4 inlet can be applied (refer to the Storm Drain Manual for details).
**Error! Not a valid bookmark self-reference.** and Figure 40 provide some additional details about setting up the inlet/channel interface.
This system shows that the bed elevation of the channel is equal to the invert elevation of the inlet.

- Channel Bed Elevation = Bank Elevation – Depth = (299.8 – 3.5) = 296.3 ft

- Inlet Elevation = 296.3 ft

Figure 41 shows a storm drain system interfacing with a channel system.
The direction of the storm drain exchange flows are based on the comparison between the water surface elevation and the pressure head which are a
function of the following:

- Channel bed elevation = inlet invert elevation

- Channel bank elevation = inlet rim elevation (typical design)

Storm Drain Outfall – Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect a storm drain outfall to a channel element the following issues should be addressed:

- Are outfalls set up as a ‘FREE’ condition type?

- Is the switch to discharge flow back to the surface ‘ON’ in the SWMMOUTF.DAT file?

Figure 42 shows a complex storm drain – channel system where a channel feeds the storm drain as an inlet and flow returns to surface channel
downstream.

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image5.png

*Figure 42.
Complex Flow Exchange between a Storm Drain System and 1-D Channel.*

Storm drain outfalls are assigned to the channel left bank element.
For most cases, the outfall invert elevation would be assigned to the channel element thalweg elevation.
If the coordinates in the SWMM.inp file are the left bank element channel coordinates, then the QGIS Plug-in will automatically assign the outfall
node to the left bank element.
The outfall should be correctly paired to the left bank element in the SWMMOUTF.DAT (Figure 43).

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image6.png

*Figure 43.
Typical Configuration of a Storm Drain Outfall Discharging to a Natural Channel.*

The Plugin uses coordinates of the different storm drain components from the SWMM.inp file to pair them with the grid elements in the surface layer.
It is usually not necessary for the outfall coordinates in the SWMM.inp to match the left bank channel element coordinate.
The position is within the channel, the outfall will be correlated in the SWMMOUTF.DAT updating the grid element number to the closest left bank
element number (Figure 41).
The user should check every outfall to be sure it is correctly assigned to the appropriate left bank grid.
In this case, the outfall coordinates in the SWMM.inp file do not have to be replaced since the storm drain discharge calculations will not be
affected.

The bank elements in FLO-2D function as both floodplain and channel elements to facilitate the channel to floodplain exchange.
The outfall should not be assigned to the left bank floodplain element.
This causes the elevation to match the grid elevation instead of the channel elevation.
Assignment of the outfall to a right bank element, or a channel interior element will generate an error message.

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image7.png

*Figure 44.
Outfall Nodes Paired to Interior Channel Elements.*

The outfall invert elevation can be less than the channel thalweg elevations (underground), and the storm drain would be assumed to be underwater with
an initial tailwater depth.
The conduit should have a positive slope to the outfall.
This configuration may represent the case for a ponded surface water condition that is assigned as a ground elevation because the ponded water will
not contribute to downstream flooding.
If the outfall invert is underground (underwater), there is an option to assign an artificial head equal to the ground elevation.
It is assigned to the outfall node for the entire simulation.
This artificial head may fill the pipe, but the volume that goes into the pipe is not considered in the FLO-2D volume conservation accounting because
the grid element is dry.
The artificial volume is accounted for in the storm drain model.
When the model runs, inflow may be added to either the outfall grid element or the upstream storm drain network and the flow can go either in or out
of the outfall pipe based on the pressure head (Figure 45).
To account for volume conservation, the storm drain outflow that represents inflow volume to a FLO-2D channel is reported in the CHVOLUME.OUT file.

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image8.png

*Figure 45.
Underground Outfall Condition.*

Water will flow in or out of the outfall pipe based on the relationship between the water surface elevation and pipe pressure head.
Water can enter the storm drain when the water surface elevation is greater than the pressure head, but it can evacuate from the storm drain if the
pressure head is above the water surface elevation.
This behavior can introduce oscillations in the system that can be explained as a respond to the surface water and storm drain pressure interaction
(Figure 46).

*Figure 46.
Inlet and Outfall Pressure Head Variation Cause Pipe Discharge Oscillations.*

Storm Drain Basin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Storm drain basins can be challenging to model because when the basin is full, the system is under pressure and the conduits and nodes feeding the
system will respond to the full basin with flow oscillations.
These oscillations are not numerical instability, they are upstream flow trying to feed the basin that is already full.
For basin modeling early builds required a flapgate.
Build 21 no longer required a flapgate but did show more fluctuations in the flow oscillations at the outfall.
Build 21 also required a grid elevation adjustment at the outfall so that the grid element elevation was adjusted to the invert of the outfall node.
Build 23 does not require a flapgate for basin outfalls or underground outfalls and flow dampening code was added to inlets to help eliminate the flow
oscillations at the full nodes and the inlet nodes connected to full conduits.
A more comprehensive documentation will be presented in Early 2024 on https://documentation.flo-2d.com on an advanced storm drain review lesson.

Storm Drain Boundary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inlet
^^^^^

If the storm drain crosses a boundary and there is inflow that enters the system at this boundary, it can be added as Time Series inflow to a Junction
type node.
Figure 47 shows this example of inflow coming from offsite via a node with a time series.
The invert elevation of the node and length of the conduit can be set to the real value to the feature that is off grid or across the boundary.
The FLO-2D Plugin will show an error if a node is off the grid.
Keep the features on grid but give them the invert and length of the regular system.
These nodes are not set up as inlets and do not exchange water with the grid/surface model.

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image10.png

*Figure 47.
Inflow Boundary at a Node.*

Outfall
^^^^^^^

A standard treatment for a storm drain conduit that crosses a boundary is to treat the outfall as if it has a discharge with no downstream control.
An outfall placed near the boundary is assigned a 0 to the Allow Discharge switch.
This system acts like a sink.
The discharge is reported but no water is returned to the surface model.
In this case, the outfall is Free and Allow Discharge is 0 (do not allow).

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image11.png

*Figure 48.
Standard Outfall at a Boundary.*

Some boundaries can change the control of the flow of a conduit crossing a boundary.
The example in Figure 49 shows an outfall to a dry trapezoidal channel.
The channel is connected to the canal system by a closed gate.
If the gate were opened, there would be a downstream control on this system.

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image12.png

*Figure 49.
Boundary Crossing with a Control.*

Sometimes the conduit crossing the system is artificially shortened because the boundary is too close to the node.
This can change the hydraulics of the water moving down the conduit.
Figure 49 could also represent this condition.
In this case, setting the conduit length to the length at the next node and making sure the slope is correct can help ensure the discharge is
correctly represented as the flow that crosses the boundary.

Storm Drain Walls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a storm drain inlet is near a wall, an adjustment might be needed to ensure that the inlet is on the correct side of the wall.

.. image:: ../img/Storm_Drain_Modeling_Guidelines/Chapter4/image13.png

*Figure 50.
Wall and Inlet Example.*

Storage Unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A storage unit can be used with FLO-2D but at this time, it must be set up using the inp file or the EPA SWMM GUI.
Set it up with a Junction Node using the FLO-2D Plugin and then convert it to a storage unit using the EPA SWMM GUI
(Figure 51).
